Ada	I was only too happy to be in such request. "For me then," returned my guardian, "or for [MASK], or for both of us. It is somebody's birthday to-morrow, I think." "
Caesar	I feel myself as far above suspicion as [MASK]'s wife." Anything to equal the lightness of his manner and the playful impartiality with which he seemed to convince himself, as he tossed the matter about like a ball of feathers, was surely never seen in anybody else!
Johnny	On accounts of this and his dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick-axe from his pocket and split [MASK]'s head (which the child knows not fear and has repeatually called after him close at his eels).
Anne	There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately" (speaking low and tremulously) "there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late." [MASK] saw the misery of such feelings.
Anne	In the course of the same morning, [MASK] and her father chancing to be alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; he thought her "less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.
Edward	"I was six weeks with [MASK]," said he, "and saw him happy. I could have no other pleasure. I deserved none. He enquired after you very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter."
Anne	but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound. "Altered beyond his knowledge." [MASK] fully submitted, in silent, deep mortification. Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for he was not altered, or not for the worse.
Tess	she said in a dreamy tone. "And I loved him so! I didn't mind his having YOU. But this about Izz is too bad!" [MASK], in her start at the words, narrowly missed cutting off a finger with the bill-hook.
Tess	"It might have been a carriage for her own kin!" Having at last taken her course [MASK] was less restless and abstracted, going about her business with some self-assurance in the thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not be onerous.
Tess	No sooner did the dark queen hear the soberer richer note of [MASK] among those of the other work-people than a long-smouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to madness. She sprang to her feet and closely faced the object of her dislike.
Tess	He hoped she would remove that prohibition soon. He proposed that the couple should take [MASK]'s own name, d'Urberville, as uncorrupted. It was better than her husbands's. He asked if any letter had come from her that day.
Alec	I thought I worshipped on the mountains, but I find I still serve in the groves! Ha! ha!" "O [MASK] d'Urberville! what does this mean? What have I done!" "Done?" he said, with a soulless sneer in the word.
Tess	[MASK], surprised beyond measure, slid farther back still on her seat, at which he urged the horse anew, and rocked her the more. "Will nothing else do?" she cried at length, in desperation, her large eyes staring at him like those of a wild animal.
Tess	[MASK] at length consented to go. Her first experience of the journey afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected, the hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her monotonous attention to the poultry-farm all the week. She went again and again.
Tess	But to [MASK] and her mother's household no such anxious farmer sent his team. They were only women; they were not regular labourers; they were not particularly required anywhere; hence they had to hire a waggon at their own expense, and got nothing sent gratuitously.
Tess	When the day grew quite strong and commonplace these dried off her; moreover, [MASK] then lost her strange and ethereal beauty; her teeth, lips, and eyes scintillated in the sunbeams and she was again the dazzlingly fair dairymaid only, who had to hold her own against the other women of the world.
Bartleby	Upon this he noiselessly slid into view. "Will you tell me, [MASK], where you were born?" "I would prefer not to." "Will you tell me _any thing_ about yourself?" "I would prefer not to."
Bartleby	At last I see it, I feel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life. I am content. Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission in this world, [MASK], is to furnish you with office-room for such period as you may see fit to remain.
Bartleby	It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined, that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand, I abruptly called to [MASK].
Bartleby	Gradually I slid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the scrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and [MASK] was billeted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence, which it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom.
Bartleby	A few days after this, my other clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else earthly to do, [MASK] would surely be less inflexible than usual, and carry these letters to the post-office.
Bartleby	But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the following little scene ensued: "[MASK]," said I, "when those papers are all copied, I will compare them with you." "I would prefer not to." "How?
Bartleby	Meanwhile [MASK] sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but his own peculiar business there. Some days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work. His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly.
Bartleby	Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would inadvertently summon [MASK], in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing some papers.
Bartleby	Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The scrivener's pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers, in its shivering winding sheet. Suddenly I was attracted by [MASK]'s closed desk, the key in open sight left in the lock.
Bartleby	Immediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or [MASK] had entirely misunderstood my meaning. I repeated my request in the clearest tone I could assume. But in quite as clear a one came the previous reply, "I would prefer not to."
Bartleby	"I prefer not to dine to-day," said [MASK], turning away. "It would disagree with me; I am unused to dinners." So saying he slowly moved to the other side of the inclosure, and took up a position fronting the dead-wall.
Bartleby	These sad fancyings--chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brain--led on to other and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of [MASK]. Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The scrivener's pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers, in its shivering winding sheet.
Bartleby	As days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to [MASK]. His steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen), his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances, made him a valuable acquisition.
Bartleby	I motioned him into the lawyer's room, who then left us. "[MASK]," said I, "are you aware that you are the cause of great tribulation to me, by persisting in occupying the entry after being dismissed from the office?"
Bartleby	Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving from his privacy, [MASK] in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, "I would prefer not to." I sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties.
Edwards	Ought I to acknowledge it? That afternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him. Some days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a little into "[MASK] on the Will," and "Priestly on Necessity.
Bartleby	Say now you will help to examine papers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two you will begin to be a little reasonable:--say so, [MASK]." "At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable," was his mildly cadaverous reply.
Bartleby	Sometimes an attorney having business with me, and calling at my office and finding no one but the scrivener there, would undertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching my whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, [MASK] would remain standing immovable in the middle of the room.
3 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as before. Again I awoke in the night, and found [MASK] sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window.
Lucy	I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. [MASK] is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....
Lucy	I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor [MASK] when the Count had sucked her blood.
Jonathan	I give rein to them, and they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which [MASK] have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours.
Lucy	[MASK] was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning.
Jonathan	Alas, but that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the Count's mind, when he seize that money, though [MASK]'s so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape.
Antigone	She looked away from me, and presently rose and went on by herself. There was something lonely and solitary about her great determined shape. She might have been [MASK] alone on the Theban plain. It is not often given in a noisy world to come to the places of great grief and silence.
Death	It had also affected the old fishermen’s hard complexions, until one fancied that when [MASK] claimed them it could only be with the aid, not of any slender modern dart, but the good serviceable harpoon of a seventeenth century woodcut.
Cox	And then there's all the rest--the putting the key back and fitting in times and all that.... Seems to me a bit too much of the Box and [MASK] trick--a sort of jig-saw puzzle, d'you see.'
Thomas	And the truth was that [MASK] did hear him, who had just opened the door to tell his young mistress that her luncheon was waiting, and whom the Archdeacon did all but knock downstairs in his sudden and unlooked-for exit.
George	She was pale, almost white, and had dark eyes and dark hair, and possessed precisely all the accessories which make a sudden change of complexion remarkable; and the effect this evening was so evident that even her husband admired her for a moment, and then stopped short to inquire, "By [MASK]!
Stephen	The boys answered him phrase by phrase. [MASK], his tongue cleaving to his palate, bowed his head, praying with his heart. --O my God!-- --O my God!-- --I am heartily sorry-- --I am heartily sorry-- --for having offended Thee-- --for having offended Thee--
Stephen	--Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of Judgement? --What is offered me on the other hand? [MASK] asked. An eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies?
Stephen	chase me, ladies, I'm in the cavalry! His fellow student's rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister of [MASK]'s mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of misrule.
Stephen	I see schemer in your face. Where did you break your glasses? [MASK] stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by fear and haste. --Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect of studies. --The cinder-path, sir. --Hoho!
Stephen	--It was a great day for European culture, he said, when you made up your mind to swear in yellow. They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a pause [MASK] began: --Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have.
Ovid	One of the first examples that he had learnt in Latin had run: INDIA MITTIT EBUR; and he recalled the shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to construe the Metamorphoses of [MASK] in a courtly English, made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and chines of bacon.
Stephen	--Good morning, everybody, said [MASK], smiling and kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu. The lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns' madhouse beyond the wall.
Stephen	[MASK] followed also with his ears the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as he spoke gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the vacation which had just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, the transference of masters.
Stephen	A figure was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the fire. [MASK] closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace. --Good morning, sir! Can I help you?
Stephen	--That idea never occurred to me, [MASK] answered. But I am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself? He turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant.
Stephen	[MASK] walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart.
Gabriel	The instant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confused form was veiling softly its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh. [MASK] the seraph had come to the virgin's chamber.
Stephen	[MASK] paused and, though his companion did not speak, felt that his words had called up around them a thought-enchanted silence. --What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in the literary tradition.
Stephen	[MASK] remained in the background, depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of jaded and formal study. On the desk he read the word FOETUS cut several times in the dark stained wood.
Stephen	The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and the tender tremors with which his father's voice festooned the strange sad happy air, drove off all the mists of the night's ill humour from [MASK]'s brain.
Stephen	You're an excitable bloody man, do you know. He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into [MASK]'s face with moved and friendly eyes, said: --Do you know that you are an excitable man?
Stephen	The light had waned. He could not see. Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh comments, the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so often [MASK]'s ardent wayward confessions?
Mary	Pray to our mother [MASK] to help you. She will help you, my child. Pray to Our Blessed Lady when that sin comes into your mind. I am sure you will do that, will you not? You repent of all those sins.
Christmas	He went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives: and though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for [MASK] his mood of embittered silence did not leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote and near.
Fleming	--Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees? What is your name, boy? --Fleming, sir. --Hoho, [MASK]! An idler of course. I can see it in your eye.
Watson	Take no further steps. I have not seen the coroner; but I will take the responsibility.' 'Well,' thought [MASK], 'it relieves me from an awkward job. None of my witnesses seemed certain of anything except the young woman.
Margaret	[MASK] sat down by her mother, and took her unresisting head on her breast, bending her own soft cheeks down caressingly to touch her face. 'Dear, darling mamma! we were so afraid of giving you pain.
Margaret	He's fairly knocked down in his mind by it. It's no use telling him, fools will always break out o' bounds. Yo' never saw a man so down-hearted as he is.' 'But why?' asked [MASK]. '
Fanny	She will be able to suggest something, perhaps--won't you, Fan?' 'I have not always an ailment,' said [MASK], pettishly; 'and I am not going with mamma. I have a headache to-day, and I shan't go out.'
Thornton	Few drapers' assistants, as he was once, could have made themselves what he is.' 'But can yo' give dinners back, in yo'r small house? [MASK]'s house is three times as big.' '
Herod	Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I! [MASK]’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile cohabitation!
Bloom	she’s far from the land. And [MASK], of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.
Elijah	And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: [MASK]!
Gerty	Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see. —O, responded [MASK], quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.
Stephen	He tugged swiftly at [MASK]’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: —Goodbye, now, goodbye!
Stephen	(There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) [MASK]! (There is no answer. He calls again.)
Strether	A woman--a particular woman--may stand that strain. But can a man?" he propounded. [MASK]'s answer was as prompt as if he had already, for himself, worked it out. "Not without a very high ideal of conduct.
Strether	"But haven't you yourself rather too much?" "Oh RATHER--!" So that after an instant, under this reproach and as if it were at last a fact really to escape from, [MASK] made his move for departure.
Strether	[MASK] hadn't pressed him as to the object of the preference so unexpectedly described; feeling in the presence of it, with one of his irrepressible scruples, a delicacy from which he had in the quest of the quite other article worked himself sufficiently free.
Strether	"It contrasts--just so; all round, and tremendously." "Therefore, perhaps, most of all with what YOU want?" "Oh," said [MASK], "what I want is a thing I've ceased to measure or even to understand."
Strether	[MASK] faced the question, and his answer was the more emphatic. "Don't put it off, my dear boy, on ME!" "Well--I see what you mean. I'm sure you'd behave beautifully but you DON'T want to see her.
Lord	And then he stooped and began punching around the keyhole with the end of a lead-pencil. When he stood up his face was exultant. "It's locked on the inside," he said in a low tone. "There is somebody in there." "[MASK] have mercy!"
Swedes	“Yes, I used to be ashamed of being a Swede, but I'm not any more. [MASK] are kind of common, but I think it's better to be SOMETHING.” “It surely is! How tall you are getting.
Anne	[MASK] took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty it was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the most fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.
Anne	[MASK], bursting into tears, rushed to the hall door, slammed it until the tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind. A subdued slam above told that the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.
Anne	She was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which [MASK] was forever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so her appearance was of minor importance.
Diana	I did not mean to--to--intoxicate [MASK]. How could I? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world. Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose?
Matthew	“I’m extremely grateful to you and [MASK]. And I’ll study as hard as I can and do my very best to be a credit to you. I warn you not to expect much in geometry, but I think I can hold my own in anything else if I work hard.”
Anne	“What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, [MASK]. You were always getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do you mind the time you dyed your hair?” “Yes, indeed.
Marilla	“I don’t believe in imagining things different from what they really are,” retorted [MASK]. “When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He doesn’t mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me.
Anne	“We were born to be good friends, [MASK]. You’ve thwarted destiny enough. I know we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your studies, aren’t you? So am I. Come, I’m going to walk home with you.”
Marilla	“She’s got too much to say,” thought [MASK], “but she might be trained out of that. And there’s nothing rude or slangy in what she does say. She’s ladylike. It’s likely her people were nice folks.”
Marilla	“I apologized pretty well, didn’t I?” she said proudly as they went down the lane. “I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it thoroughly.” “You did it thoroughly, all right enough,” was [MASK]’s comment.
Aladdin	Is there anything you want--money, or what? I should like to have [MASK]'s lamp--though I'd hardly need it--that you might have no wish unsatisfied." He had found her very backward in asking for things that she needed.
Jo	"I'm not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two tails till I'm twenty," cried [MASK], pulling off her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane.
Beth	I never made any plans about what I'd do when I grew up. I never thought of being married, as you all did. I couldn't seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little [MASK], trotting about at home, of no use anywhere but there.
Jo	and I could do as well as that if we tried," returned [MASK], amused at his admiration of the trash. "I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good living out of such stories, they say.
Beth	[MASK] kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving. All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting.
Meg	"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely mended, it shows, and [MASK] told me to keep still so no one would see it.
Jo	Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant. But your absurd words are as bad as [MASK]'s slang.
Jo	[MASK] sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney. "I should like much to send all the rest after him," muttered the Professor, coming back with a relieved air.
Fritz	"Boys. I want to open a school for little lads--a good, happy, homelike school, with me to take care of them and [MASK] to teach them." "That's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her?
Jo	Just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so everyone could see." "Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?" asked [MASK], who relished the scrape. "Laugh?
Jo	The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green leaves. [MASK] announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise develops wholesome appetites.
Kemp	"Yes?" "You know the red colouring matter of blood; it can be made white--colourless--and remain with all the functions it has now!" [MASK] gave a cry of incredulous amazement. The Invisible Man rose and began pacing the little study.
Kemp	I don't know what your plans are, but of course I'm anxious to help you." The Invisible Man sat down on the bed. "There's breakfast upstairs," said [MASK], speaking as easily as possible, and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose willingly.
Kemp	"I'll see what there is to eat downstairs," said [MASK]. "Not much, I'm afraid." After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible Man demanded a cigar.
Kemp	Burning! I had burnt my boats--if ever a man did! The place was blazing." The Invisible Man paused and thought. [MASK] glanced nervously out of the window. "Yes?" he said. "Go on.
Griffin	But still I don't see quite ... I can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone, but personal invisibility is a far cry." "Precisely," said [MASK]. "But consider, visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light.
Kemp	"No one would know he was a confederate," said the Invisible Man, eagerly. And then suddenly, "Hush! What's that downstairs?" "Nothing," said [MASK], and suddenly began to speak loud and fast.
Jim	"Wouldn't [MASK] let you have any of the money he had won to pay for a lodging?" "No; I axed him for five cents, but he wouldn't let me have it." "Can you get lodging for five cents?"
Dick	To make a long story short, the captain, seeing how matters stood, brought [MASK]'s cat ashore, and she soon made the rats and mice scatter. The king was highly delighted when he saw what havoc she made among the rats and mice, and resolved to have her at any price.
May	Little arduous as his professional duties were, he would have been convicted of frivolity by the whole Mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a holiday in mid-winter; and he accepted [MASK]'s departure with the resignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal constituents of married life.
Indians	She appreciated the homely ease of village life. She liked the old men, farmers, G.A.R. veterans, who when they gossiped sometimes squatted on their heels on the sidewalk, like resting [MASK], and reflectively spat over the curb. She found beauty in the children.
Eppie	" "Oh, I'm stronger than you think, daddy," said [MASK]; "and if there wasn't stones enough to go all round, why they'll go part o' the way, and then it'll be easier to get sticks and things for the rest.
Silas	She held [MASK]'s hand in hers, and grasped it firmly--it was a weaver's hand, with a palm and finger-tips that were sensitive to such pressure--while she spoke with colder decision than before.
Silas	For joy is the best of wine, and [MASK]'s guineas were a golden wine of that sort. He rose and placed his candle unsuspectingly on the floor near his loom, swept away the sand without noticing any change, and removed the bricks.
George	I loved you then as I do now. I must tell you. I think I loved you from the first minute that I saw you, when [MASK] brought me to your house, to show me the Amelia whom he was engaged to.
Amelia	In this room was all [MASK]'s heart and treasure. Here it was that she tended her boy and watched him through the many ills of childhood, with a constant passion of love. The elder George returned in him somehow, only improved, and as if come back from heaven.
Horace	As I doubt not but you are both excellent classics, suppose, for the good of your own memories, and the entertainment and surprise of the company, the thousand pounds should fall to the share of him who can repeat by heart the longest ode of [MASK]?"
Madame	“You desired my presence, [MASK],” he said frigidly. “I take it that it was not with the view to indulging in tender reminiscences.” His voice certainly was cold and uncompromising: his attitude before her, stiff and unbending. Womanly decorum would have suggested
Chauvelin	[MASK] had sworn to bring the Scarlet Pimpernel to the guillotine, and now the daring plotter, whose anonymity hitherto had been his safeguard, stood revealed through her own hand, to his most bitter, most relentless enemy.
Chauvelin	[MASK] stood beside her, his shrewd, pale, yellow eyes fixed on the pretty face, which looked so sweet and childlike in this soft English summer twilight. “You surprise me, citoyenne,” he said quietly, as he took a pinch of snuff.
Chauvelin	[MASK] was evidently devoured with impatience. Apparently he trusted no one: this last trick played upon him by the daring Scarlet Pimpernel had made him suddenly doubtful of success, unless he himself was there to watch, direct and superintend the capture of this impudent Englishman.
Sophia	With this, he had likewise that distinguishing taste, which serves to direct men in their choice of the object or food of their several appetites; and this taught him to consider [MASK] as a most delicious morsel, indeed to regard her with the same desires which an ortolan inspires into the soul of an epicure.
Umslopogaas	[MASK], too, had his axe, of which no effort had been made to deprive him, and now he whirled it round his head and sent his piercing Zulu war-shout echoing up the marble walls in fine defiant fashion.
Death	ay, the power that shall lie in the dust at its ending. So short is our life; yet with space for all things to forsake us, A bitter delusion, a dream from which nought can awake us, Till [MASK]’s dogging footsteps at morn or at eve shall o’ertake us.
Oliver	The blessing was from a young child's lips, but it was the first that [MASK] had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it. CHAPTER VIII
Nancy	'Good-night, [MASK],' said the Jew, muffling himself up as before. 'Good-night.' Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no flinching about the girl.
Fagin	As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before. 'What'll [MASK] say?' inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question.
Fagin	'[MASK],' said the jailer. 'That's me!' cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial. 'An old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!'
Oliver	But, for many days, [MASK] remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.
Nancy	Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of dress being provided from the Jew's inexhaustible stock,--Miss [MASK] prepared to issue forth on her errand.
Oliver	The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear. 'What!' said the master at length, in a faint voice. 'Please, sir,' replied [MASK], 'I want some more.'
Bill	Say another word, and I'll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, [MASK], wrench the shutter open. He's game enough now, I'll engage.
Fagin	Don't put on an injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler.' These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. It was answered by another Jew: younger than [MASK], but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance.
Oliver	With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to [MASK]. 'So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?' said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; 'eh?'
Monks	'Will _he_ be here to-night?' asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before. '[MASK], do you mean?' inquired the landlord, hesitating. 'Hush!' said the Jew. 'Yes.'
Oliver	[MASK] did as he was desired. Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep. CHAPTER IX CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS
Oliver	'We'll cure you of that, my young master.' The Jew inflicted a smart blow on [MASK]'s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand.
Monks	'Whose turn would that have served, my dear?' inquired the Jew humbly. 'Mine,' replied [MASK]. 'But not mine,' said the Jew, submissively. 'He might have become of use to me.
Oliver	[MASK] knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot-cleaning. 'Go!' exclaimed the Dodger. 'Why, where's your spirit?'
Oliver	[MASK] sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.
Oliver	Grind him to ashes! He'd start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!' 'I am sorry,' stammered [MASK], confused by the strange man's wild look. 'I hope I have not hurt you!'
Oliver	For many days, [MASK] remained in the Jew's room, picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning.
Tom	The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. [MASK] eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too.
Tom	Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. [MASK] believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given over.
Tom	The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to [MASK] for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.
Tom	He held his candle aloft and said: “Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on the big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.” “[MASK], it's a _cross_!”
Tom	[MASK], what's the matter with you?” “Oh, auntie, I'm--” “What's the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?” “Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!”
Tom	I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.” “Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and all that.” By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, [MASK] in the lead.
Tom	At last [MASK] rose slowly and softly, and started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never made a second attempt.
Tom	[MASK] said: “Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay home from school.”
Tom	And you try and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any more medicine.” [MASK] reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly.
Tom	She begged to see. [MASK] said: “Oh, it ain't anything.” “Yes it is.” “No it ain't. You don't want to see.” “Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”
Tom	So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. [MASK] sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it.
Tom	[MASK] presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away--ever so far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas--and never came back any more!
Tom	He took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles. In it lay a marble. [MASK]'s astonishment was bound-less! He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said: “Well, that beats anything!”
Tom	Monday morning always found him so--because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious. [MASK] lay thinking.
Tom	[MASK] was a free boy again, however--there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now--but found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.
Tom	But there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. [MASK] was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters.
Tom	D'you reckon he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?” “By hokey, that's so, [MASK]!” “And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!”
Tom	“There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself. “Who cares!” said [MASK]. “Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate.
Tom	“[MASK], what on earth ails that cat?” “I don't know, aunt,” gasped the boy. “Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?”
Tom	Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, [MASK] watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such small comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get hold of.
Tom	By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His second was to wait--for there might not be any more storms. The next day the doctors were back; [MASK] had relapsed.
Tom	[MASK] hesitated and looked confused. “Speak out, my boy--don't be diffident. The truth is always respectable. What did you take there?” “Only a--a--dead cat.” There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.
Tom	You're_ up a stump, ain't you!” No answer. [MASK] surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before.
Tom	“I'd know it better if you acted more like it.” “I wish now I'd thought,” said [MASK], with a repentant tone; “but I dreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?”
Tom	“But they don't.” “Well, if they like it, [MASK], all right; but I don't want to be a king and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say--where you going to dig first?”
Tom	At home [MASK] learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the “ragged man's” body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.
Tom	“Hallo, he's stopped!--Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!” People in the branches of the trees over [MASK]'s head said he wasn't trying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed. “Infernal impudence!
Tom	“Goody!... No, [MASK], that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse town. They ain't no numbers here.” “Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute.
Tom	The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension. CHAPTER XXV THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire suddenly came upon [MASK] one day.
Tom	They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought them to the spring, and [MASK] felt a shudder quiver all through him.
Tom	He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure. Why call [MASK] now?
Tom	“I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.” “[MASK], I better go.” “Well, go 'long--who's hendering you.”
Tom	“No--never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody.” “But I must! _Don't_ groan so, [MASK], it's awful. How long you been this way?” “Hours.
Agnes	Can I ever forget?’ ‘As you were then, my sister, I have often thought since, you have ever been to me. Ever pointing upward, [MASK]; ever leading me to something better; ever directing me to higher things!’
Agnes	yes!--Agnes, sitting on the seat before me, in the same box, with a lady and gentleman beside her, whom I didn’t know. I see her face now, better than I did then, I dare say, with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me. ‘[MASK]!’
Steerforth	‘Yes; or hate,’ laughed [MASK]; ‘no matter which. Come! Say the next day!’ I said the next day; and he put on his great-coat and lighted his cigar, and set off to walk home.
Agnes	Her colour came and went once more; and once more, as she bent her head, I saw the same sad smile. ‘You will wait and see papa,’ said [MASK], cheerfully, ‘and pass the day with us?
Uriah	‘Before I come here,’ said [MASK], stealing a look at us, as if he would have blighted the outer world to which we belonged, if he could, ‘I was given to follies; but now I am sensible of my follies.
Heathcliff	He thought me too poor to wed his sister,' answered [MASK], 'and was grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he'll never forgive it.' 'That's wrong!' said the young lady: 'some time I'll tell him so.
Catherine	She lay still now, her face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit: our fiery [MASK] was no better than a wailing child. 'How long is it since I shut myself in here?' she asked, suddenly reviving. '
Cathy	And, in the morning, I often feel sick--papa says I grow so fast.' Badly satisfied, [MASK] sat down, and he reclined beside her. 'This is something like your paradise,' said she, making an effort at cheerfulness.
Heathcliff	My master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. [MASK] dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak.
Ellen	May we not go a little way--half a mile, [MASK], only just half a mile? Do say Yes: to that clump of birches at the turn!' I refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended: the travelling carriage rolled in sight.
Heathcliff	'Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!' 'Did _she_ take due warning, then?' asked [MASK], attempting a sneer.
Catherine	And [MASK] has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by him. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her horse.
Catherine	Hush, hush, [MASK]! I'll stay. If he shot me so, I'd expire with a blessing on my lips.' And there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the stairs--the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.
Heathcliff	It's surely no great cause of alarm that [MASK] should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft. I'll engage he's lurking there. See if I don't ferret him out!'
Pap	“GIT up! What you 'bout?” I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. [MASK] was standing over me looking sour and sick, too.
Jim	but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? [MASK] said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show.
Jim	[MASK] he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.
Jim	Jump up and crack yo' heels! Dat's de good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!” I says: “I'll take the canoe and go and see, [MASK]. It mightn't be, you know.”
Jim	He raised considerable row about it, but me and [MASK] stuck to it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind,
Jim	I sung out for [MASK] about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.
Jim	Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned [MASK] had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him.
Jim	and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it. [MASK] put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again.
Jim	But we got to have it anyway. Come along.” So they got out and went in. The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and [MASK] come tumbling after me.
Jim	He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. Then he says: “Maybe I better not tell.” “Why, [MASK]?” “Well, dey's reasons. But you wouldn' tell on me ef
Jim	[MASK] he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.
Jim	He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going to let [MASK] find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
Tom	The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. [MASK] was joyful. He says; “Now we're all right. We'll _dig_ him out.
Jim	I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah--watched um thoo de bushes.” Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. [MASK] said it was a sign it was going to rain.
Jim	“Most everybody thought it at first. He'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named [MASK].” “Why _he_--” I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still.
Jim	Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head.” “Why, [MASK], you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little. You could tame it.”
Jim	So [MASK] and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable.
Sherburn	Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street he would tear again, and give [MASK] another cussing.
Jim	I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. [MASK] knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn't any good-luck signs.
Jim	I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out: “Set her loose, [MASK]! we're all right now!” But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.
Jim	We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told [MASK] to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light.
Jim	When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made [MASK] lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off.
Jim	And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make [MASK] just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.
Jim	He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but [MASK] wouldn't let me. He said it was death.
Tom	CHAPTER XLII. THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no track of [MASK]; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything.
Tom	But [MASK] he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.
Jim	THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running--was [MASK] a runaway nigger? Says I: “Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?”
Tom	That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; [MASK] said he'd _got_ to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.
Grangerford	“I reckon maybe--I don't know.” “Well, who done the shooting? Was it a [MASK] or a Shepherdson?” “Laws, how do I know? It was so long ago.” “Don't anybody know?”
Jim	About two they come up again, though, and [MASK] was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard.
Tom	Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_. Next night we stuck a picture, which [MASK] drawed in blood, of a skull and crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door.
Jim	So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and [MASK] got it all right, along with her shingle nail, before noon.
Jim	But [MASK] was dead against it at first. He says: “I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. We's doin' blame' well, en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says.
Jim	That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told [MASK] everything. CHAPTER XXXI. WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river.
Jim	she's all fixed up agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o' stuff, in de place o' what 'uz los'.” “Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, [MASK]--did you catch her?”
Clifford	But, as the sunlight left the peaks of the Seven Gables, so did the excitement fade out of [MASK]'s eyes. He gazed vaguely and mournfully about him, as if he missed something precious, and missed it the more drearily for not knowing precisely what it was.
Phoebe	It really seemed as if the battered visage of the House of the Seven Gables, black and heavy-browed as it still certainly looked, must have shown a kind of cheerfulness glimmering through its dusky windows as [MASK] passed to and fro in the interior.
Phoebe	And then, while the yellow richness of the declining sunshine still fell into the open space of the garden, [MASK] brought out a loaf of bread and a china bowl of currants, freshly gathered from the bushes, and crushed with sugar.
Phoebe	He saw [MASK], however, and caught an illumination from her youthful and pleasant aspect, which, indeed, threw a cheerfulness about the parlor, like the circle of reflected brilliancy around the glass vase of flowers that was standing in the sunshine.
Tarzan	Presently his quick ears detected the familiar sound of padded feet and the brushing of a huge, fur-clad body through the undergrowth. [MASK] came quietly above the unsuspecting beast and silently stalked him until he came into a little patch of moonlight.
Tarzan	The mighty tusker turned at the sound of his falling body, and, seeing only the easy prey of a young ape, he lowered his head and charged madly at the surprised youth. [MASK], happily, was uninjured by the fall, alighting catlike upon all fours far outspread to take up the shock.
Tarzan	So much had [MASK] seen that day that his head was in a whirl of wonder. But the most wonderful sight of all, to him, was the face of the beautiful white girl. Here at last was one of his own kind; of that he was positive.
Tarzan	But his fangs never closed in that nut brown flesh. A muscular hand shot out and grasped the hairy throat, and another plunged a keen hunting knife a dozen times into the broad breast. Like lightning the blows fell, and only ceased when [MASK] felt the limp form crumple beneath him.
Tarzan	Not so, however, with [MASK], the man-child. His life amidst the dangers of the jungle had taught him to meet emergencies with self-confidence, and his higher intelligence resulted in a quickness of mental action far beyond the powers of the apes.
Tarzan	The greater strength of the ape was slowly prevailing, and the teeth of the straining beast were scarce an inch from [MASK]'s throat when, with a shuddering tremor, the great body stiffened for an instant and then sank limply to the ground.
Tarzan	well, for time and again the ferocious brute had established his claim to physical supremacy over the few bull apes who had dared resent his savage bullying. [MASK] would have liked to subdue the ugly beast without recourse to knife or arrows.
Tarzan	[MASK] took to the trees in pursuit, and in a few moments came in view of the men desperately striving to escape. There were three of them, and they were racing madly in single file through the dense undergrowth.
Tarzan	What was that?" suddenly cried one of the party, an Englishman, as [MASK]'s savage cry came faintly to their ears. "I heard the same thing once before," said a Belgian, "when I was in the gorilla country.
Jane	But [MASK] did not once lose consciousness. It is true that that awful face, pressing close to hers, and the stench of the foul breath beating upon her nostrils, paralyzed her with terror; but her brain was clear, and she comprehended all that transpired.
Tarzan	She realized that it was because she had forgotten the fear that prompted her to accept it. Motioning her to follow, [MASK] walked toward the trees at the edge of the arena, and taking her in one strong arm swung to the branches above.
Tarzan	During this period [MASK] paid many nocturnal visits to the village, where he often renewed his supply of arrows. He soon noticed the food always standing at the foot of the tree which was his avenue into the palisade, and after a little, he commenced to eat whatever the blacks put there.
Tarzan	[MASK] shook his head and taking the bark, wrote: I had thought of that--the first day; but I dared not. The great apes come often to this spot, and if they found you here, wounded and alone, they would kill you.
Tarzan	[MASK] coiled his rope. Then there rose suddenly above the fiendish cries of the dancing demons the awful challenge of the ape-man. The dancers halted as though turned to stone. The rope sped with singing whir high above the heads of the blacks.
Tarzan	On the day that [MASK] established his right to respect, the tribe was gathered about a small natural amphitheater which the jungle had left free from its entangling vines and creepers in a hollow among some low hills. The open space was almost circular in shape.
Tarzan	No one was in sight. His eyes rested upon the open doorway of a nearby hut. He would take a look within, thought [MASK], and so, cautiously, he approached the low thatched building. For a moment he stood without, listening intently.
Tarzan	By constant playing and experimenting with these he learned to tie rude knots, and make sliding nooses; and with these he and the younger apes amused themselves. What [MASK] did they tried to do also, but he alone originated and became proficient.
Tarzan	Once every moon [MASK] would go swinging rapidly back through the swaying branches to have a day with his books, and to replenish his supply of arrows. This latter task was becoming more and more difficult, for the blacks had taken to hiding their supply away at night in granaries and living huts.
Tarzan	In them, too, was greed for the toothsome dainty the boy carried. But [MASK] saw his arch enemy as quickly, and divining what the great beast would do he leaped nimbly away toward the females and the young, hoping to hide himself among them.
Tarzan	He was now swimming parallel to the bank and there he saw the cruel beast that would have seized him crouching upon the still form of his little playmate. The lioness was intently watching [MASK], evidently expecting him to return to shore, but this the boy had no intention of doing.
Tom	“Heard the latest?” said [MASK], coming in late one drizzly evening with that triumphant air he always wore after a successful conversational bout. “No. Somebody flunked out? Or another ship sunk?” “Worse than that.
Swinburne	One poem they read over and over; [MASK]'s “Triumph of Time,” and four lines of it rang in his memory afterward on warm nights when he saw the fireflies among dusky tree trunks and heard the low drone of many frogs.
Frankenstein	The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, [MASK]. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.
Frankenstein	So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of [MASK]--more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
Elizabeth	It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and [MASK] therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.
Satan	Many times I considered [MASK] as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me. "Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.
Elizabeth	"Have you, then, some other attachment?" "None on earth. I love [MASK] and look forward to our union with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin."
Frankenstein	I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from [MASK] the particulars of his creature's formation, but on this point he was impenetrable. "Are you mad, my friend?" said he.
Felix	I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent [MASK] flitted before me.
Clerval	But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of [MASK] will be ever whispered in my ear.
Justine	You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune." [MASK] shook her head mournfully. "I do not fear to die," she said; "that pang is past.
Elizabeth	For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils--one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim [MASK] and forget the past in my union with her.
Justine	My cousin wept also. "Oh, [MASK]!" said she. "Why did you rob me of my last consolation? I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now." "
Justine	A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to [MASK], but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.
Frankenstein	"You, who call [MASK] your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions.
Agatha	The gentle words of [MASK] and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch! "Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.
Elizabeth	I hastened to return home, and [MASK] eagerly demanded the result. "My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. But she has confessed."
Felix	[MASK] rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.
Coleridge	Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turned round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread. [[MASK]'s "Ancient Mariner."]
Justine	I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor [MASK] had been.
Agatha	[MASK] listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father.
Esau	Who blames her? Something is lost in the passage of every soul from one eternity to the other,--something pure and beautiful, which might have been and was not: a hope, a talent, a love, over which the soul mourns, like [MASK] deprived of his birthright.
George	“But [MASK] isn't saving. He's reckless, and even if he is arrogant and conceited and bad-tempered, he's awfully generous.” “Oh, he's an Amberson,” said her father.
George	It seems to me the finest house I've seen in this part of the country.” [MASK] was outraged by an enthusiasm so ignorant--not ten minutes ago they had passed the Amberson Mansion. “Is that a sample of your taste in architecture?”
Chopin	She played no marche funebre upon her piano, even though [MASK]'s romantic lamentation was then at the top of nine-tenths of the music-racks in the country, American youth having recently discovered the distinguished congeniality between itself and this deathless bit of deathly gloom.
Magua	The escape was soon known; and the whole tribe crowded, in a body, around the council-lodge, impatiently awaiting the instruction of their chiefs. In such a sudden demand on their wisdom, the presence of the cunning [MASK] could scarcely fail of being needed.
Magua	“Monster! there is blood, oceans of blood, upon thy soul; thy spirit has moved this scene.” “[MASK] is a great chief!” returned the exulting savage, “will the dark-hair go to his tribe?” “Never!
Hawkeye	As [MASK] and the Mohicans had, however, often traversed the mountains and valleys of this vast wilderness, they did not hesitate to plunge into its depth, with the freedom of men accustomed to its privations and difficulties.
Indian	And the fellow will drink when he can get an opportunity; your drinking [MASK] always learns to walk with a wider toe than the natural savage, it being the gift of a drunkard to straddle, whether of white or red skin. 'Tis just the length and breadth, too!
Magua	An unwilling maiden makes an unhappy wigwam.” “She speaks with the tongue of her people,” returned [MASK], regarding his victim with a look of bitter irony. “She is of a race of traders, and will bargain for a bright look.
Hawkeye	“These devils will scale heaven to circumvent us to our ruin,” said [MASK]; “keep him in play, boy, until I can bring 'killdeer' to bear, when we will try his metal on each side of the tree at once.”
Hawkeye	[MASK] dropped the breech of his rifle to the earth, and drawing a long, free breath, exclaimed, in an audible whisper: “Ay! they respect the dead, and it has this time saved their own lives, and, it may be, the lives of better men too.”
Jacob	Thus voyaging, I came to my old friend, “[MASK]’s Ladder,” and felt the ledge of the masonry under me. I crouched down in the shadow of the great pipe--I tried to stir it, but it was quite immovable--and waited.
Helen	He continued lounging on the sofa, and alternately closing his eyes and looking at his watch and at me, till bed-time, when I rose, and took my candle and retired. ‘[MASK]!’ cried he, the moment I had left the room.
Helen	I therefore hesitated to reply. Perhaps my former answer had implied too much: he had heard my voice falter, and might have seen me brush away a tear. ‘Are you going to forgive me, [MASK]?’ he resumed, more humbly.
Arthur	‘Then you will leave me again, [MASK]?’ said I. ‘Yes, dearest, but only to love you the better when I come back, and make up for all past offences and short-comings; and you needn’t fear me this time: there are no temptations on the mountains.
Verloc	This could not last. “Rotten weather,” he growled savagely. “Mild,” said the Assistant Commissioner without passion. He remained silent for a little while. “We’ve got hold of a man called [MASK],” he announced casually.
Okonkwo	He exchanged greetings with [MASK] and led the way into his obi. "1 was coming over to see you as soon as I finished that thatch," he said, rubbing off the grains of sand that clung to his thighs. "Is it well?"
Okonkwo	[MASK] had committed the female, because it had been inadvertent. He could return to the clan after seven years. That night he collected his most valuable belongings into head-loads. His wives wept bitterly and their children wept with them without knowing why.
Okonkwo	And they might also have noticed that [MASK] was not among the titled men and elders who sat behind the row of egwugwu. But if they thought these things they kept them within themselves. The ec)wuc)wu with the springy walk was one of the dead fathers of the clan.
Okonkwo	She set the pot on the fire and [MASK] took up his machete to return to his obi. "You must watch the pot carefully,” he said as he went, "and don't allow it to boil over. If it does its power will be gone."
Okonkwo	Some days later, when the land had been moistened by two or three heavy rains, [MASK] and his family went to the farm with baskets of seed-yams, their hoes and machetes, and the planting began.
Okonkwo	This year they were the wise ones. They sympathized with their neighbors with much shaking of the head, but inwardly they were happy for what they took to be their own foresight. 24 [MASK] planted what was left of his seed-yams when the rains finally returned.
Okonkwo	I know more about the world than any of you. If there is any one among you who thinks he knows more let him speak up." He paused, but no one spoke. "Why is [MASK] with us today? This is not his clan.
Okonkwo	He rose and left the hut. [MASK] did as the priest said. He also took with him a pot of palm-wine. Inwardly, he was repentant. But he was not the man to go about telling his neighbors that he was in error.
Okonkwo	The drums beat the unmistakable wrestling dance —quick, light and gay, and it came floating on the wind. [MASK] cleared his throat and moved his feet to the beat of the drums. It filled him with fire as it had always done from his youth.
Okonkwo	When [MASK] heard that he would not eat any food he came into the hut with a big stick in his hand 28 and stood over him while he swallowed his yams, trembling. A few moments later he went behind the hut and began to vomit painfully.
Okonkwo	It was like the good old days again, when a warrior was a warrior. Although they had not agreed to kill the missionary or drive away the Christians, they had agreed to do something substantial. And they had done it. [MASK] was almost happy again.
Okonkwo	If one says no to the other, let his wing break." After the kola nut had been eaten [MASK] brought his palm-wine from the corner of the hut where it had been placed and stood it in the center of the group.
Okonkwo	The elders sat in a big circle and the singers went round singing each man's praise as they came before him. They had something to say for every man. Some were great farmers, some were orators who spoke for the clan,- [MASK] was the greatest wrestler and warrior alive.
Tortoise	They painted their bodies with red cam wood and drew beautiful patterns on them with uli. "[MASK] saw all these preparations and soon discovered what it all meant. Nothing that happened in the world of the animals ever escaped his notice,- he was full of cunning.
Okonkwo	The rainbow was called the python of the sky. [MASK] called his three wives and told them to get things together for a great feast. "1 must thank my mother's kinsmen before 1 go," he said.
Okonkwo	This year they talked of nothing else but the nso-ani which [MASK] had committed. It was the first time for many years that a man had broken the sacred peace. Even the oldest men could only remember one or two other occasions somewhere in the dim past.
Ford	he waved at where it had been. There was a potted plant there now. “But where are we?” said [MASK], who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand.
Arthur	[MASK] tried to gauge the speed at which they were traveling, but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points. The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all.
Arthur	[MASK] discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his head. He smiled weakly. “Charming man,” he said. “I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one ...”
Arthur	“Good grief,” said [MASK], “is this really the interior of a flying saucer?” Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets.
Marvin	“Life,” said [MASK] dolefully, “loathe it or ignore it, you can’t like it.” The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it, revealing a network of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails.
Arthur	“You were upset!” “Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn’t have mattered so much. It was a quite shocking cock-up.” “Huh?” said [MASK]. “The mice were furious.” “The mice were furious?”
Arthur	At that moment the bottom fell out of [MASK]’s mind. His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of his head. The room folded flat around him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own navel.
Ford	The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the screen. [MASK] pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as well in a still, quiet, measured voice.
Zaphod	“Then turn the bloody engines back on!” bawled [MASK]. “Oh, sure thing, guys,” said the computer. With a subtle roar the engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back toward the missiles again.
Zaphod	Another voice broke in, presumably Halfrunt. He said “Veil, [MASK]’s just zis guy, you know?” but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and through the radio’s on/off-sensitive airspace.
Ford	A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with his huge blubbery arms. “You can’t throw us into space,” yelled [MASK], “we’re trying to write a book.” “Resistance is useless!”
Zaphod	“No, we’re also going to ... er ... take evasive action!” said [MASK] with a sudden access of panic. “Computer, what evasive action can we take?” “Er, none, I’m afraid, guys,” said the computer.
Arthur	[MASK] agreed this was very sad. He did this with a 7! small feeble gesture, because he was too asphyxiated to speak. Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard. “Well. Now you put it like that I suppose ...”
Ford	Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing. “How did we get here?” he asked, shivering slightly. “We hitched a lift,” said [MASK].
Ford	“Resistance is useless!” “Oh, give it a rest,” said [MASK]. He twisted his head till he was looking straight up into his captor’s face. A thought struck him. “Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?”
Arthur	The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly [MASK] had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like. It wasn’t infinity in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting. Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity—distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless.
Zaphod	“Are you telling me,” he said, “that you set yourself up to become President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?” “That’s it,” said [MASK] with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls.
Macbeth	“Oh, good Lord! You’ve got it going and coming, haven’t you!” “Is this a dagger that I see before me? Wasn’t, you know. But you could never convince [MASK] it wasn’t.”
Frankenstein	Both physical and otherwise. Especially physical. It all sounds like science fiction. Like the story of [MASK]. But then, science fiction is only a wild extension of reality, no? My Love, perhaps some people are hiding some very frightening collective secrets.
Gandhi	The pedestal and the surrounding high platforms were all fixed. The stage was painted in the colors of the flag, green, white, and orange. There was a tall palm tree and a model of the charka. Someone had wheeled in a giant cutout of [MASK].
Satan	She would pray later. “Glory and praise be to You, O God; blessed is Your name and exalted is Your majesty. There is no God other than You. I come, seeking shelter from [MASK], the rejected one. ”
Allah	Who is he? Abruptly the singing stopped. The assistants vanished and the fakir threw his arms wide and bellowed. “O evil jinni, leave that woman’s body! By the command of [MASK], leave her. Sky! Water! Air! Fire!”
Rufino	The trial was on TV all day long for almost a month. Three of the murderers did finally admit to killing one each of the Mirabal sisters. Another one killed [MASK], the driver. The fifth stood on the side of the road to warn the others if someone was coming.
Sam	[MASK]’s return greeting sounded as if it had been spoken from under the counter; he stood open-mouthed, angrily watching the little black man poised in the open doorway and busily flickering his beady, suspicious eyes around the cafe’s interior.
Plato	and would laugh with hate at the bringer of unwanted light if what they knew they needed was the dark. He had told a story he said had meant more to him in his unhappiness than any other story, something he called the myth of [MASK]’s cave.
Insulin	The young councilman regarded his cigar stub thoughtfully and tossed it into the incinerator chute. ‘I fail to see the analogy. [MASK] will bring a diabetic to normal without the faintest need of a knife, but appendicitis needs an operation. You can’t help that.
Nick	Then the car starts and then it stops again, and the Commander is helping me up. “We’ll have to be fast,” he says. “This is a back entrance. You should leave the cloak with [MASK].
Luke	I’ve never worn anything remotely like this, so glittering and theatrical, and that’s what it must be, an old theater costume, or something from a vanished nightclub act; the closest I ever came were bathing suits, and a camisole set, peach lace, that [MASK] bought for me once.
Jezebel	This too we shall never know. Did our narrator reach the outside world safely and build a new life for herself? Or was she discovered in her attic hiding place, arrested, sent to the Colonies or to [MASK]’s, or even executed?
Ayla	“I’ll cut circles out of the mammoth leather, then cut holes around the edges, thread some cord through, and tie it around the horses’ ankles. If mammoth hide can keep our feet from getting cut up by the ice, it’s bound to protect theirs,” [MASK] explained.
Wolf	“Many wolves stay with their pack, but some wolves leave and become loners until they find another loner for a mate. Then a new pack starts. [MASK] is still young, hardly more than a cub. He looks older because he’s so big.
Ayla	The path continued downhill and [MASK] decided to follow it a ways. As she walked along, the region felt so much like the area around the cave where she grew up that she had the haunting feeling she had been there before.
Ayla	Finally the mamut spoke. “Why should we believe you? How do we know you are not trying to trick us? You say she is of the Mammoth Hearth, but where is her mark? She has no tattoo on her face.” [MASK] spoke up.
Jack	[MASK] saw her turn the corner. He looked in all directions before moving, a habit he had quickly cultivated and hoped he would be able to discard very soon. He moved quickly to meet her. The street was quiet.
Jack	“So what’s your idea then?” [MASK] rubbed back his hair, dug his fingers into his leg until the pain in his knee subsided and then lay down on the seat. “Who-ever’s behind all this wanted the letter opener back really bad.
Richard	At the station [MASK] gave his name and address and age and occupation. Then for the first time he stated that he was not involved, and asked one of the other boys to corroborate his testimony. This they rather despairingly did.
Job	“It ain’t my fault,” she said, “that you was born a fool, and al- ways done been a fool, and ain’t never going to change. I swear to my Father you’d try the patience of [MASK].”
John	That he had been a preacher at that time was not astonishing, for it was impossible to imagine that he had ever been anything else; but that he had had a wife in the so distant past who was now dead filled [MASK] with a wonder by no means pleasant.
Satan	Then, trembling, he got out of bed again and washed himself. It was a warning, and he knew it, and he seemed to see before him the pit dug by [MASK]—deep and silent, waiting for him.
Fonny	I had nothing to say. “You sure you want this baby, Tish?” my father asked me. “Oh, yes,” I said, “and [MASK] wants it, too! It’s our baby," I said.
Noah	Here we are in the last quarter and how we gonna pull it all together and claim the new age in our name? How we gonna rescue this planet from them radioactive mutants? No wonder [MASK] tried to bar them from the ark. Hmph.
Napoleon	Good for the eyes, the sinuses, the heart. The body needs to throw off its excess salt for balance. Too little salt and wounds can’t heal. Remember [MASK]’s army? Those frogs were dropping dead from scratches because their bodies were deprived of salt.
Sirius	I painted the head of a dog on the canvas in red paint because I had yet to learn I was not a Canis. My father had told me years before that I was born under the starsign of the Dog because [MASK] was overhead at the time.
Freddie	He looked at me hard for a long moment. Come on, [MASK], he said, why did you kill her? I stared back at him. I did not like his contemptuously familiar tone -Freddie, indeed! - but decided to let it go.
Charlie	I seemed to move as if under a magic spell, I do not know how it worked, but for a while, for an hour or two, posing as [MASK]’s factotum, I was released from myself and the terrors that had been pursuing me relentlessly for days.
Mary	He was nursing a Bloody [MASK]. She ordered a Screwdriver from the waitress, then spoke. “Listen, daddy, I’m sure glad to get you alone for a minute. You’re getting as hard to catch up to as greased lightning.
Romeo	And he had had the sense to foresee it. His abrupt departure from her life had been much in the romantic tradition established by [MASK] in the balcony window. His alternatives had been the same. ‘I must be gone and live, or stay and die!’
Coach	I could feel your eyes on me wherever I went. Did I tell you how mad [MASK] got when you came to sit next to me on the bench? He thinks it sets a bad example for his best player to hold hands with his wife during the game.
Himmel	“Gott im [MASK].” Will the passenger in boat 37 please remain seated! After a day filled with centrifugal spins and free-falls, it was hard to tell whether I was dizzy with love or with motion sickness.
Godot	We sat at the bus stop, chewing off the ears of shortbread circus animals and enacting an urban version of Waiting for [MASK]. “You’re sure you don’t mind the pumpkin seeds?” “That depends. Do you want to grow carrots?”
Sam	Then, “[MASK], why doesn’t he get here? It’s almost nine.” “You must be hungry.” “It isn’t that. But why doesn’t he come?” “Maybe he’s tied up, maybe he found out something important.”
Sam	You say he already checked out of the hotel yesterday.” “Now wait a minute, Sheriff,” [MASK] said. “You’re jumping to conclusions. You’ve got nothing to go by except what this man Bates said over the phone just now.
Hamlet	There was the ghost of [MASK]’s father, for example. No time to think about that now. He had to get down to the motel and open up. There’d been some business during the week, not very much.
Montag	He and the white plaster walls inside were much the same. There was white in the flesh of his mouth and his cheeks and his hair was white and his eyes had faded, with white in the vague blueness there. Then his eyes touched on the book under [MASK]’s arm
Montag	“Goodbye.” “Goodbye. . . o o o One two three four five six seven days: the firehouse. “[MASK], you shin that pole like a bird up a tree.” Third day.
Montag	The other firemen waited behind him, in the darkness, their faces illumined faindy by the smoldering foundation. [MASK] started to speak twice and then finally managed to put his thought together. “Was it my wife turned in the alarm?”
Faber	The only thing I positively knew was gone was the books I’d burned in ten or twelve years. So I thought books might help.” “You’re a hopeless romantic,” said [MASK]. “It would be funny if it were not serious.
Montag	“You should’ve gone two hours ago. I just noticed.” “It’s not just the woman that died,” said [MASK]. “Last night I thought about all that kerosene I’ve used in the past ten years. And I thought about books.
Mildred	He carried the books into the backyard and hid them in the bushes near the alley fence. For tonight only, he thought, in case she decides to do any more burning. He went back through the house. “[MASK]?”
Montag	What do you think, [MASK]?” “I think I was blind trying to go at things my way, planting books in firemen’s houses and sending in alarms.” “You did what you had to do. Carried out on a national scale, it might have worked beautifully.
Montag	It listens! If you put it in your ear, [MASK], I can sit comfortably home, warming my frightened bones, and hear and analyze the firemens world, find its weaknesses, without danger. I’m the Queen Bee, safe in the hive.
Montag	“No.” [MASK] gazed beyond them to the wall with the typed lists of a million forbidden books. Their names leapt in fire, burning down the years under his axe and his hose which sprayed not water but kerosene. “No.”
Shakespeare	“Well, that’s one way to get an audience. Hold a gun on a man and force him to listen to your speech. Speech away. What’ll it be this time? Why don’t you belch [MASK] at me, you fumbling snob?
Mildred	He stared at the parlor that was dead and gray as the waters of an ocean that might teem with life if they switched on the electronic sun. “Now,” said [MASK], “my ‘family’ is people. They tell me things; I laugh, they laugh!
Beatty	“Tomorrow. The next day maybe. First of the week.” [MASK] puffed his pipe. “Every fireman, sooner or later, hits this. They only need understanding, to know how the wheels run. Need to know the history of our profession.
Montag	And there on the small screen was the burnt house, and the crowd and something with a sheet over it and out of the sky, fluttering, came the helicopter like a grotesque flower. So they must have their game out, thought [MASK].
Prometheus	One man’s head was pillowed on the plinth that held the Bound [MASK], and his face had the same wracked expression as the carved countenance above him. No one, it seemed, had got across the river with a full kit.
Jo	[MASK] never could stitch an even hem; her mind was always wandering off to the plot of her latest story, so that her sheets and kerchiefs had a kind of meandering scallop to their edges. I had often teased her about her rococo needlework.
Amy	Carefully, I drew forth the locks and laid them in the circle of candlelight. One fat curl in gleaming yellow, tied with a bow of pink satin: my little [MASK]’s glory. A mouse brown wisp from my tranquil Beth.
JSOW	And that was when the line collapsed. I don’t remember it all at once. I see these flashes: people running, grunts, reporters. I remember a newsman 4- JSF: Joint Strike Fighters. 5. [MASK]: Joint Standoff Weapon.
Bradleys	You know they even tried to dig fighting holes for the tanks? The engineers blasted them right out of the A&P parking lot. You had tanks? Dude, we had everything: tanks, [MASK], Humvees armed with everything from fifty cals to these new Vasilek heavy mortars.
Temperance	" "I mean, do you belong to the order of Odd Fellows?" "No, no; I belong to the order of married men." "Are you a mason?" "No, I am a carpenter by trade." "Are you a Son of [MASK]?"
Asclepius	But when you called it a caduceus, you made a very common mistake. The caduceus has two snakes on the staff and wings at the top. Your amulet has a single snake and no wings. Your symbol is called—” “The Rod of [MASK].”
Medusa	Finally, he reached a dead end at a small viewing platform near the base of the cistern’s rightmost wall. There before him was an incredible sight. Rising out of the water was a colossal carved marble block—the head of [MASK]—her hair writhing with snakes.
Langdon	The time stamp on-screen indicated that the footage had been cued to midmorning yesterday—precisely twenty-four hours ago—apparently just before the museum opened and long before the arrival of [MASK] and the mysterious il Duomino that evening.
Langdon	His partner gave a reluctant nod. “Do it.” [MASK] felt powerful fingertips expertly probing the arteries and veins on his neck. Then, having located a precise spot on the carotid, the fingers began applying a firm, focused pressure.
Silas	[MASK] lurched into the entryway delirious with exhaustion. Dropping to his knees on the tile floor, he cried out for help. Everyone in the reception area gaped in wonderment at the half-naked albino offering forth a bleeding clergyman.
Sophie	“The letters RS. . . . do they mean anything else to you? Anything at all?” Afraid their voices might echo down the hall, [MASK] pulled him into the Salle des Etats and closed the enormous twin doors silently, sealing them inside.
Langdon	It was how he activated the security system.” [MASK] looked back at the gate, trying to picture what had happened. “The curator was attacked in his office, fled into the Grand Gallery, and activated the security gate by pulling that painting from the wall.
Langdon	Two cryptexes. Everything in pairs. Double entendres. Male female. Black nested within white. [MASK] felt the web of symbolism stretching onward. White gives birth to black. Every man sprang from woman. White—female. Black—male.
Napoleon	When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books—books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As [MASK] once said, ‘What is history, but a fable agreed upon?’ ” He smiled.
Langdon	[MASK] turned. "Why would you assume that?” “Because you were brought here, Professor. You were chosen. This inscription appears to be a code of some sort, and considering your reputation, it seems obvious to me that you were brought here to decipher it.”
Langdon	“Director," [MASK] replied instantly, “this little pyramid is not the Masonic Pyramid.” “So it is merely coincidence that we found a pyramid hidden at the heart of the U.S. Capitol in a secret chamber belonging to a Masonic leader?”
Langdon	On the coffee table before them, [MASK]’s leather bag was still open, the golden capstone peeking out the top. The words Eight Franklin Square had now faded away, leaving no evidence that they had ever existed.
Langdon	brilliantly. Not only had [MASK] reunited the pieces of the Masonic Pyramid, he had figured out how to solve the arcane grid of symbols on the base. At first glance, the symbols seemed indecipherable . . . and yet the answer was simple . . .
Langdon	“Whatever you believe this engraving reveals,” [MASK] said, “it won’t be the Ancient Mysteries.” “Of course not,” he replied. “The mysteries are far too vast to be written on the side of a little stone pyramid.”
Langdon	I thought this was a map.” [MASK] looked equally perplexed, the excitement in his eyes evaporating. “This decryption obviously is correct, but. . “The man who has my brother wants to know a location." She tucked her hair behind her ear.
Lilith	Perhaps because they wanted to see how far human beings had to be pushed before they broke. Perhaps they even wanted to see how each individual broke. Or perhaps the Oankali version of stubbornness was so extreme from a human point of view that very few humans tried their patience. [MASK] had not.
Lilith	[MASK] was to choose and Awaken no fewer than forty. No wall would open to let her or those she Awakened out until at least forty human beings were ready to meet the Oankali. The great room was darkening slightly. Evening.
Velcro	The jacket adhered to itself and stayed closed when she closed it, but opened readily enough when she pulled the two front panels apart. The way they came apart reminded her of [MASK], though there was none to be seen. The pants closed in the same way.
Nikanj	After a moment, he nodded. I put him to sleep. He did not realize it, but I was responsible for strengthening his aversion to [MASK]. No male or female who spent as much time with an ooloi as he had with me would feel comfortable touching another ooloi.
Nikanj	When [MASK] brought it to me after several days of reconstruction, it was not yet recognizable. Not like a Human or an Oankali or any construct 1 had ever seen. Its skin was deep gray. Patches of it still glistened with slime.
Nikanj	1 wasn’t shy or afraid, but when I thought of going to her, I felt first drawn, then . . . almost repelled. Finally there was my ooloi parent, [MASK]. It would tell me to go to one of my same-sex parents—one of my fathers.
Nikanj	I had to touch it sometimes to rouse it. It was as though it were lost within itself, and only surfaced when we were in contact. It rarely spoke. When we were ready to go, [MASK] stood between my Oankali parents to give me final advice and to say goodbye.
Job	I had shrugged off my aunt and uncle’s strict Baptist teachings years before. But even now, especially now, the bitter melancholy words of [MASK] could still reach me. “Man that is bom of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.
Ender	“Took you long enough. You have a battle today.” So [MASK] got up and fought the battle and won it. But there was no second battle that day, and they let him go to bed earlier. His hands were shaking as he undressed.
Ender	Would you bet the human race on the chance of them giving up and leaving us alone?” [MASK] tried to grasp the amounts of time that had gone by. “And the ships have been traveling for seventy years—” “Some of them.
Ender	Worst of all, though, was the number of people. [MASK] had no important memories of the scale of the cities of Earth. His idea of a comfortable number of people was the Battle School, where he had known by sight every person who dwelt there.
Ender	He put on the mask. It closed him in like a hand pressed tight against his face. But this isn’t how it feels to be a bugger, thought [MASK]. They don’t wear this face like a mask, it is their face.
Ender	“I changed my mind, pinprick. Maybe by practicing with your Launchies you’ll learn something, and I can trade you easier. Anything to get rid of you faster.” “Thank you, sir,” [MASK] said.
Ender	These were not pieced together from the censored public videos, but whole and continuous. Since many videos were working in the major battles, they studied bugger tactics and strategies from many angles. For the first time in his life, a teacher was pointing out things that [MASK] had not already seen for himself.
Ender	[MASK] meant to shower right away, but he was also tired. He lay down on his bed in his flash suit, just for a moment, and woke up at the beginning of lunchtime. So much for his idea of studying more about the buggers this morning.
Ender	“If [MASK] isn’t the one, if his peak of military brilliance does not coincide with the arrival of our fleet at the bugger homeworlds, then it doesn’t really matter what our training method is or isn’t."
Ender	I was defending myself. I bore it a long time. I was patient. I’m not what he said. A voice over the speaker told them they were approaching the school; it took twenty minutes to decelerate and dock. [MASK] lagged behind the others.
Ender	“I’m telling you things that you can’t know, by the way, if you’re ever going to leave I.F. Command. Before the war’s over.” [MASK] was angry. “If you know me at all, you know I can keep a secret.”
Montaigne	He had not even reached the second chapter (the one on idleness) before his pointed chin was digging into his chest and his reading glasses had fallen into his lap. So he did not reach-and this is a great shame-[MASK]'s essay on smells.
Harry	“You lied to him and you drank your cyanide like a little gentleman. You died like a poisoned rat, [MASK], but you’re no rat to me.” I had to search him. It was a nasty job.
Norris	’’ It was like that, over and over again, lying on the bed and watching the patch of sunlight slide down the corner of the wall. Then the phone rang, and it was [MASK], the Sternwood butler, with his usual untouchable voice.
Helen	Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying, And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying. [MASK], thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore That gently, o’er a perfumed sea
Mary	They knew the country intimately rather than in detail; few of them were of the stuff of which naturalists are made; but they belonged to it, looked like it, smelled of it. The smells in her schoolhouse, in fact, kept [MASK] amused when there was dearth of other entertainment.
John	He felt aggrieved, too, that the baby had died before he had even made the rounds of the farm in his fathers arms.[MASK] had meant to take him once he was old enough to be out from under the constant domination of his mother.
Jim	And that night, after the boat had returned [MASK] and his father to their ship, and she was at last in bed, she fell immediately asleep in spite of a melancholy determination to review in every minutest detail a most momentous day and to see herself as one who had resolutely put away all childish things.
Cyclops	Besides, she would never agree. She’s extremely shy and has the modesty of a white woman. —Actually it doesn’t matter if it exists or not, as long as people believe it does. Do mermaids have tails? Does [MASK] have one eye?
Collodi	Then he had taken private lessons from an old lady. He was supposed to read and translate [MASK]’s Pinocchio, but when he had done a few sentences the teacher would take the book out of his hands and do the reading and translating herself.
Aladdin	Is there anything you want--money, or what? I should like to have [MASK]'s lamp--though I'd hardly need it--that you might have no wish unsatisfied." He had found her very backward in asking for things that she needed.
Jenny	Now he feels skinless and broken. He wonders if all his efforts to think like [MASK] are making him into a Jennylike person. But that isn’t fair; she’s not foolish or helpless. Far from it.
Vera	How many are there? Ten?" "Yes—ten there are." [MASK] cried: "What fun! They're the ten little soldier boys of the nursery rhyme, I suppose. In my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the mantelpiece."
Owen	If I were to commit one or more murders it would be solely for what I could get out of them. This mass clearance isn't my line of country. Good, then we'll eliminate ourselves and concentrate on our five fellow prisoners. Which of them is U. N. [MASK].
Lombard	[MASK] said: "It's true, my dear." He paused and then said: "There's one other little fact. A pane in the dining room window has been smashed—and there are only three little soldier boys on the table." Fifteen
Marple	There was no body, a suitcase and clothes were taken—what else could I think?" "And your sister had been—recently—rather— ahem"—Miss [MASK] coughed delicately—"interested in—in a certain gentleman?"
Congress	“You authorized it. It is my duty under the law to report on these matters to [MASK]. Before I do so, I felt it necessary to notify you. I asked the two congressmen here to witness my doing so.”
Jack	They got there too late. [MASK] opened the door to see the bed covered with a sheet. The doctors had already left. “I was there at the end. He went out easy,” one of the CIA people told him.
Jack	There had been blood in the back of the Rolls—not just blood. The driver’s head had been blown apart, and his brains had scattered into the passenger compartment. [MASK] winced thinking about it. The escort had probably leaned over to push the button before defending himself. . . .
Jack	“Settle down, boy,” the pilot suggested. “He has a real talent for pissing me off,” [MASK] said after another deep breath. “I know he’s an asshole, but he almost lost his kid. Try to remember that.
Fools	I admired her work in Why Do [MASK] Fall in Love?, especially her character’s vulnerability even as the woman’s life added harder and harder layers. I liked her even more in Set It Off, especially when she gets angry at the timid girl in the gang after their first successful bank robbery.
Halloween	“When I was a cop we always dreaded [MASK] because that’s when the young brothers collectively lose their minds. They rob the trick-or-treaters. They do home invasions when people open their front doors to give out candy.
Barney	I closed my eyes and invited all the spirits I could stand, but what about the song? The only one that came immediately to mind was the [MASK] classic, “I love you, you love me.” I was hoping for something a little more soulful, but first thought, best thought.
Aristotle	Profugiorum ab Aerumna. She was praised for the way she analyzed [MASK]’s definition of place in the Physics. Each thing exists in nlace. Each thing is described by place. Would this new knowledge have pleased her mother? She did not know.
Playboy	So the great unwashed public had never spied upon her luscious nipples or her silken blond bush, even though [MASK] and similar magazines had begged, pleaded, even cried for her to reveal all—offering vast sums of money for the privilege. It was never enough.
Rocky	It goes on for fucking ever in every direction. You’re lucky I’m here at all.” “You really crack me up,” said [MASK], who looked like a poor man’s Sylvester Stallone—hence the name.
Rue	I really think I stand a chance of doing it now. Winning. It’s not just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few times, although those things help. Something happened when I was holding [MASK]’s hand, watching the life drain out of her.
Peeta	My stomach is in no way satisfied. “Tomorrow’s a hunting day,” I say. “I won’t be much help with that,” [MASK] says. “I’ve never hunted before.” “I’ll kill and you cook,” I say.
Effie	Still final good-byes must be said here. [MASK] takes both of us by the hand and, with actual tears in her eyes, wishes us well. Thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor.
Katniss	Well, well, well. [MASK], there’s no guarantee there’ll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with the Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay clear of archery. Are you any good at trapping?”
Peeta	2HH Before I can stop myself, I call out [MASK]’s name. paRT mi THE VICTOR ◄ I clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has already escaped. The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid!
Gale	You’re the best hunter I know,” says [MASK]. “It’s not just hunting. They’re armed. They think,” I say. “So do you. And you’ve had more practice. Real practice,” he says.
Peeta	They’re nightlock. You’ll be dead before they reach your stomach.” Just then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting [MASK] to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away.
Peeta	And while I was talking, the idea of actually losing [MASK] hit me again and I realized how much I don’t want him to die. And it’s not about the sponsors. And it’s not about what will happen back home.
Haymitch	It’s bad though. They’ll throw us into the arena no matter what condition we’re in. “I know we promised [MASK] we’d do exactly what they said, but I don’t think he considered this angle.”
Rue	Especially the Careers. They, at least, can be made to pay for [MASK]’s death. No one materializes though. There aren’t many of us left and it’s a big arena. Soon they’ll be pulling out some other device to force us together.
Haymitch	See, they’d have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population. People would need to know what you did. But they can’t since it’s secret, so it’d be a waste of effort,” says [MASK].
Prim	I’ve never felt lonelier since the Games began. Just accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself. I try not to, but I can’t help thinking of my mother and [MASK], wondering if they’ll sleep a wink tonight.
Cinna	This day belongs to [MASK]. He’s my last hope. Maybe he can make me look so wonderful, no one will care what comes out of my mouth. The team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms.
Peeta	Once were in the arena, there’s detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly [MASK] really, there’s no question he’s carrying this romance thing on his shoulders.
Bosch	You knew what would happen with a guy like that. Look at the Night Stalker. He’ll never get the gas. Or it’ll take twenty years.” [MASK] felt uncomfortable. He had only thought of his motives and actions in the Dollmaker case when alone.
Christmas	He spoke again. “Any possibility your British colleague simply skipped town? Do you know for a fact that his mother died?” I thought of my Tidewater morgue supervisor, who had quit before [MASK] without giving notice or a reason.
Moses	The door of the chapel, which faced them, had the Lessford quar-terings carved in the stone on each side and a great window above with stained glass showing [MASK] and the Burning Bush. The priest turned a key in the lock and motioned him to go in.
Paul	“I heard much talk of [MASK], but it was not permitted me to speak to him in his prison cell. It was a matter of much regret to this insignificant seeker after the truth who has heard that the tongue of the apostle is like a blade of the sharpest edge.”
Augustus	Perhaps he was to be singled out for some kind of honor. He felt a lift of spirits as he glanced about the lofty, resounding hall with its enormous pillars that had been raised to the glory of [MASK], the first of the emperors.
Haitian	On the levee are a few river rats, young boys, both [MASK] and Dominican, who for food or one or two coins, will carry people and their merchandise across the river on their backs. The current is swelling, the pools enlarging.
Pele	“Each night ancestors walk this land. Can you feel it?” he asked. “The island has much mana because it is the birthplace of Kamehameha I. And because [MASK] lives here. That’s why, I believe, you were called.”
Deer	[MASK] would run if they heard people talking. Being able to see pretty well in the moonlight, they were liable to scare all too easily, anyhow. They could have meat or they could have conversation, but they couldn’t have both.
Ice	You can do your own washin’, or you can leave it here at the laundry. We won’t run much past fall, I ought to tell you. [MASK] starts runnin’ in the river then, and we tie up for the winter.
George	“She can be kind to an old man like me, and let me sit there, and talk, and argue. She’s a comrade, a good comrade, and much more than that. Clever—by [MASK], yes, with a proper woman’s cleverness!
Sam	Anybody winning?” [MASK] came down the narrow, iron steps, slapping the bannister with a broad, black hand. It rang across the common room. Half a dozen men sitting about in reading cubicles, tape niches, or discussion comers looked up, smiled.
Krishna	Yes again— [MASK] and the gopis, village belle at the well. . . . And the menu— Oh no, not again— Yes, again— Tikka masala, tandoori grill, navrattan vegetable curry, dal makhni, pappadum.
Americans	“It’s not like that now. It’s—” She stopped talking when the waitress put their sandwiches before them. But they were not sandwiches as [MASK] know them. An English cheese sandwich was a piece of cheese on two pieces of buttered white bread.
Beli	She told her vecinos that the baby had died. Some people believed her. [MASK], after all, had been ailing for a while. The tiniest litde negrita on the planet. Fuku, part three. But most folks figured that she had sold the girl to some other family.
Trujillo	Ask any of your elders and they will tell you: [MASK] might have been a Dictator, but he was a Dominican Dictator, which 25. He wished that could also have been the case with his Balaguer contact.
Rick	In actuality it had probably been a manual laborer, a field hand, with aspirations for something better. Do androids dream? [MASK] asked himself. Evidently; that’s why they occasionally kill their employers and flee here. A better life, without servitude.
Iran	He stretched out on the bed, dust sifting from his clothes and hair onto the white sheets. No need to turn on the mood organ, [MASK] realized as she pressed the button which made the windows of the bedroom opaque. The gray light of day disappeared.
Rachael	“You don’t really mean it,” [MASK] said. “You’ll never call me. You don’t realize how agile an illegal escaped Nexus-6 is, how impossible it’ll be for you. We feel we owe you this because of—you know.
Isidore	“I c-c-can’t use the vidphone,” [MASK] protested, his heart laboring. “Because I’m hairy, ugly, dirty, stooped, snaggle-toothed, and gray. And also I feel sick from the radiation; I think I’m going to die.”
Deckard	“To find yourself a bounty hunter’s assignment all of a sudden. Or whatever it is you are, [MASK].” He pressed a key on his desk intercom and said, “Send one of the bounty hunters in here; I don’t care which one.
Houdini	Suddenly he collapsed in a heap. There were exclamations of disbelief followed by prolonged applause. His assistants helped him to a chair. [MASK] asked for a glass of wine to restore his strength. He held the wine up in the spotlight. It turned colorless.
Houdini	[MASK] was to tell no one of this strange confrontation. He went through the celebrations of his jailhouse feat in an uncharacteristically quiet, even subdued manner. Not even the lines at the box office following the stories in the evening papers could cheer him up.
Walker	An old sergeant with many years on the street, a veteran of Hell's Kitchen and the Tenderloin, said The crucial thing, sir, is to get this Coalhouse [MASK] engaged in conversation. With an armed maniac, talking calms him down.
Evelyn	Most of these are today in private collections. [MASK] came nearly every afternoon and stayed for as long as she could. She dressed down to be as inconspicuous as possible. Following a Thaw practice she paid great sums of money to the chauffeur to keep him quiet.
Houdini	Just call me [MASK], he said. An enterprising reporter decided to find the great magician and solicit a comment. He was that kind of reporter expert in the stupid and inconsequential news story so loved by the papers of the time.
Bees	He heard his sister inhale. Then, as though some retaining cord had reached its limit, something yanked him back into the cellar beneath the Hotel of [MASK]. The floor has stopped shaking, but the sound has not diminished. He clamps his palm to his right ear.
Adam	We've always done it; have gone to war, again and again, over words and names. You may recall that in the legend reporting the creation of [MASK], the first thing that he did, after surveying his surroundings, was to name everything in sight.
Johnny	Go ahead, [MASK]. Tell us all about it.” The men were pleased to be included in the conversation. They pocketed their awls. Some rested their elbows on their knees and cupped their chins in their hands.
Cleopatra	A hot July, of course—he might have been drinking. But what was all this about rats and feminine frailty? Asps at [MASK]’s bosom... venom... ingratitude? Women who gave their all? Babes in the gutter?
Rachel	My footsteps crunched slightly on the gravel path. I heard a voice call down to me, ‘Do you often go walking in the woods at night?’ It was my cousin [MASK]. She was sitting, without a light, at the open window of the blue bedroom.
Judas	A denial heralded the thrice crowing of a cock, and an insincerity was like the kiss of [MASK]. The adult mind can lie with untroubled conscience and a gay composure, but in those days even a small deception scoured the tongue, lashing one against the stake itself.
John	There was a dull smouldering smell, and a wisp of smoke blew past the windows of the gallery. “They are setting fire,” said [MASK] quietly, “to the stables and the farm buildings before the house.”
Mary	No, I couldn’t return to [MASK]’s, or to the campus, or to the Brotherhood, or home. I could only move ahead or stay here, underground. So I would stay here until I was chased out.
Taboo	He must have been sitting there when I came in, for on a table that held a beautiful dwarf tree I saw smoke rising from a cigarette in a jade ash tray. An open book, something called Totem and [MASK], lay beside it.
Baby	But she knew she could not wait for ever; the child was now six weeks old and everybody simply called him “[MASK]”. She washed him, and with the money she had saved from the rent went out in search of a place to buy cigarette cartons on the black market.
Caesar	There are ways to do things, and ways not to do them.’ ‘Render under [MASK]?’ the runner said. ‘I cannot discuss this subject while I bear this,' the padre said, his hand flicking for an instant toward the crown on his cuff.
Tom	Byeee!” 9 a.m. Brief moment of party oasis when an invitation arrived in the post but turned out to be party mirage: invitation to a sale of designer eyewear. 11:30 a.m. Called [MASK] in paranoid desperation to see if he wanted to go out tonight.
JERICHO	14 the WALLS OF [MASK] “Don’t let ’im surprise y\ He kin wrastle the hell out of a piano.” “Piano don’t fight back.” “Don’t it? Well—neither will you if he get the same hold on y\” “Humph.
JERICHO	Pounding on his head—pounding— gone quite crazy, pounding. The super was stunned less by the pounding than by the fact that the boy 20 THE WALLS OF [MASK] ***» kept doing it. Even after he was shaken off, the boy kept fighting aggressively.
Napoleon	The incongruous small squawks issuing out of that dark emptiness pronounced the Commandant as pleased as I was appalled, as if I had done a fine portrait of him as one of [MASK]’s marshals he had once so admired, rather than a painting of a lousy fish.
Audubon	[MASK] painted marriages, courting, all the vain pretence of polite society, & all of it was birds & all of his birds sold & it was all up a very clever thing that he was doing, a natural history of the new burghers.
Vivaldi	Even the owner stayed huddled over a small bar radiator at the far end of his domain, his back turned to me, surreptitiously slipping off that vile anthem of contemporary retailing, [MASK]’s Four Seasons, and putting on the comforting low rubato of the races, a golden slipper of sound.
Jim	He had come from somewhere else and he agreed with [MASK] that the town was devoid of opportunity—“Deader than a mackerel,” as he put it. He pointed down the street to the stack of a steamboat tied up against the levee.
Bond	[MASK] drove it hard and well and with an almost sensual pleasure. It was a battleship-grey convertible coupe, which really did convert, and it was capable of touring at ninety with thirty miles an hour in reserve.
Bond	Or something like that, thought [MASK] as he pushed his way through the swing doors of the salle privee and nodded to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it is to bar your entry and your exit with the electric foot-switch which can lock the doors at any hint of trouble.
Gordon	‘Oui, monsieur.’ ‘Just a moment. Three measures of [MASK]’s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel.
Lenin	Here was a chance for that big step forward. What would the medal be? The Order of [MASK]? He listened carefully. ‘The target is an English spy. You would like to kill an English spy?’ ‘Very much indeed, Comrade Colonel. ’
Hope	But give up [MASK] is exactly what they did, over and over again. The doctors ordered my parents to stop trying; they refused. They are not quitters. They tried and tried, and finally came me.
Amy	I’d already pictured myself with a regular woman—a sweet, normal girl next door—and I’d already pictured telling this regular woman the story of [MASK], the lengths she had gone to—to punish me and to return to me.
Kincaid	“That kind of second-guessing could get out of hand,” [MASK] said. “Sometimes it does”—Kincaid was definitely no fool—“did you tell him that you’re a magistrate?” “Yes.” “That’s why he didn’t kill you.”
Ann	He is, I know, silently wishing us both clear sailing toward the next horizon. 12 [MASK] is standing in the emergency room lobby all alone, in her but-toned-up tan trench coat, bare-legged, wearing worn white running shoes.
Hitler	He had been three years old when [MASK] came to power, seven when his parents had been taken away in a black van; he had been hidden in an attic for another three years until, at the age of ten in 1940, he too had been discovered and taken away in a van.
Hitler	It made for itself almost everything it could ever need, and used the slave laborers, which by [MASK]’s decree were the property of the SS, to do the work. The third stage of the exploitation lay in the corpses of the dead.
Whitman	I copied more than I had intended to because I thought the last part would amuse you. Anyway, the notes in his journal gave me so many ideas that I had only to choose the best of them, like picking chocolates from a box of [MASK]’s Sampler.
Lenin	The country had been freed of Russian rule in 1918—of [MASK]’s dictum “Two steps forward and one step back,” this had been a step back—and had gotten rather to enjoy being a free nation. But its days were numbered and nothing could be done about it.
Jamie	Her spouse sank down on his haunches beside me, and began to rub [MASK]’s frozen feet in a businesslike way between large blunt-fingered hands, pausing occasionally to sip his whisky. Turning back the blankets in bits, I surveyed the damage.
Jamie	There’s several about the Duke as ha’ traded a sore arse for lands and offices.” “Ye’ll notice I havena got either one,” responded [MASK] with a grin, to further roars of laughter. “What? Never even got close?”
Jamie	I had always loved watching them as he lectured. “Tell me about your husband,” said [MASK], as though he had been reading my mind. I almost jerked my hands away in shock. “What?” “Look ye, lass.
Jamie	“You are welcome, ma niece,” he said, inclining his head. I was a little startled at the greeting, but bowed back. “I’m grateful for your hospitality,” I said, meaning it. “Have—have you seen [MASK]?”
Sassenach	“How the bloody hell did you know what I was thinking?” I demanded, ignoring the grin. He shook his head good-naturedly. “You’d make a verra poor spy, [MASK]. Everything ye think shows on your face, plain as day.
Jamie	“My hair? What’s wrong wi’ my hair?” [MASK] demanded, putting a hand up to check. Grown nearly to shoulder-length, he had as usual laced it back with a leather thong to keep it out of his face.
Jamie	If I were married to a Scot, I would presumably no longer be watched and guarded. It would be that much easier to get away when the time came. And if it were [MASK]—well, he liked me, clearly.
Jamie	I came up to find [MASK] eyeing me steadily. “I said I wouldna ask for anything you did not wish to tell me,” he said, “and I won’t, but I draw my own conclusions.
Jamie	He’ll calm down in an hour or two. Then you can—” “Have more faith in your laird,” [MASK] countered. “He’ll see the rightness in the change, once it’s finished.
Death	[MASK] makes them more beautiful. It’s something about their bodies on display in final repose—eyes wide open, lips blue, limbs stiff, skin cold. Finally, it might be said, they are at peace.
Huntington	“[MASK]’s chorea. At the end he didn’t even recognise his wife. It was horrible. For everyone. Changed everyone’s life to see him die that way.” He blinked several times and gave his attention to his cigarette and then to his fingernails.
Jacob	During that time he had been ordained, had made his decision to be part of his father’s work, had laboured like [MASK] in pursuit of a Rachel he could never be certain of winning. Yet that thought had not discouraged him.
Malik	We wouldn’t even remember it if the Indian army hadn’t taken such a beating. It didn’t mean a thing to most people. All right, said [MASK], smiling. You tell us then—what was more important than the ’62 war?
Case	The second step took her over an outstretched arm. Uniform sleeve bright with fresh blood. Glimpse of a shattered fiberglass shockstave. Her vision seemed to have narrowed to a tunnel. With the third step. [MASK] screamed and found himself back in the matrix.
Molly	“She dreamed of a state involving very little in the way of individual consciousness,” 3Jane was saying. She cupped a large cameo in her hand, extending it toward [MASK]. The carved profile was very much like her own. “Animal bliss.
Molly	They chose to regard the entire operation as an elaborate private joke, and their choice of comsats seemed to have been deliberate. [MASK]’s signals were being beamed up from a one-meter umbrella dish epoxy-ed to the roof of a black glass bank tower nearly as tall as the Sense/Net building.
Case	“Go on. You’ll enjoy this, [MASK]. Like Christmas morning.” Summer in the Sprawl, the mall crowds swaying like windblown grass, a field of flesh shot through with sudden eddies of need and gratification.
Case	“So it’s getting ready to bum itself?” [MASK] began to punch the deck nervously, at random. The matrix blurred, resolved, and he saw the complex of pink spheres representing a sikkim steel combine.
Molly	The operation hadn’t worked. He was still here, still meat, no [MASK] waiting, her eyes locked on the circling knives, no Armitage waiting in the Hilton with tickets and a new passport and money. It was all some dream, some pathetic fantasy....
Case	Some of the material had been print records, reeling smoothly down the screen, too quickly, and [MASK] had had to ask the computer to read them for him. Other segments were audio recordings of the Screaming Fist hearing.
Case	[MASK] felt the stuff had grown somehow during their absence. Or else it seemed that it was changing subtly, cooking itself down under the pressure of time, silent invisible flakes settling to form a mulch, a crystalline essence of discarded technology, flowering secretly in the Sprawl’s waste places.
Case	[MASK] jacked in and flipped for the matrix. “Get my wire?” “Yeah.” He saw that the Chinese program had grown; delicate arches of shifting polychrome were nearing the T-A ice. “Well, it’s gettin’ stickier,” the Flatline said.
Molly	“Another injection, probably,” 3Jane said, straightening up. “He was quite impatient for your arrival. I think it might be fun to nurse you back to health, [MASK].” She smiled, absently wiping a bloody hand down the front of the robe.
Molly	3Jane asked, her voice a child’s. “I think you would.” “The code,” [MASK] said. “Tell the head the code.” Jacking out. “She wants it,” he screamed, “the bitch wants it!”
Case	Bought a go-to for each of your aliases and ran the skim through some military software. You’re suicidal. [MASK]. The model gives you a month on the outside. And our medical projection says you’ll need a new pancreas inside a year.”
Case	“Well, come on. I’ll show you a little bit of Straylight while I got you here.” He lifted the comer of the blanket. White light poured out. “Shit, man, don’t just stand there.” [MASK] followed, rubbing his face.
Job	Poor as [MASK]’s turkey, but his folks came over in 1619, and one of them was the younger son of an earl. Not that bragging about blood cuts any ice with me. I was never one to trade on your ancestors, good or bad.
Sayuri	“[MASK]-san, you may not realize it, but one of the things that goes on between a geisha and her danna can cause the geisha to become pregnant, do you understand? And a man will become very upset if his mistress gives birth to another man’s child.
Ralph	“Perhaps that’s what the beast is—a ghost.” The assembly was shaken as by a wind. “There’s too much talking out of turn,” [MASK] said, “because we can’t have proper assemblies if you don’t stick to the rules.”
Ralph	The forests re-echoed; and birds lifted, crying out of the treetops, as on that first morning ages ago. Both ways the beach was deserted. Some littluns came from the shelters. [MASK] sat down on the polished trunk and the three others stood before him.
Ralph	The twins nodded like one boy. “Yes, that’s right. Let’s go up there in the morning.” [MASK] looked out and saw the sea. “We’ve got to start the fire again.”
Piggy	“How did your friend blow the conch?” “He kind of spat,” said [MASK]. “My auntie wouldn’t let me blow on account of my asthma. He said you blew from down here.”
Jack	His voice was loud and savage, and struck them into silence. “There was a ship.” [MASK], faced at once with too many awful implications, ducked away from them. He laid a hand on the pig and drew his knife.
Jack	“Through here—” “But he’d do us!” “Through here, I said—” The boar was floundering away from them. They found another pig-run parallel to the first and [MASK] raced away.
Ralph	He says will it come back tonight?” “But there isn’t a beastie!” There was no laughter at all now' and more grave w'atch-ing. [MASK] pushed both hands through his hair and looked at the little boy in mixed amusement and exasperation.
Ralph	The meeting setded down again. “So you see,” said [MASK], “we need hunters to get us meat. And another thing.” He lifted the shell on his knees and looked round the sunslashed faces. “There aren’t any grownups.
Jack	So did you.” “Call me a coward then.” [MASK] turned to the hunters. “He’s not a hunter. He’d never have got us meat. He isn’t a prefect and we don’t know anything about him.
Piggy	There was silence, except for the multitudinous murmur of the bees. At last [MASK] spoke, kindly. “’Course we have. ’Cos the smoke’s a signal and we can’t be rescued if we don’t have smoke.” “I knew that!”
Jack	I’m talking about the beast. Be frightened if you like. But as for the beast—” [MASK] paused, cradling the conch, and turned to his hunters with their dirty black caps. “Am I a hunter or am I not?”
Ralph	It’s time some people knew they’ve got to keep quiet and leave deciding things to the rest of us.” [MASK] could no longer ignore his speech. The blood was hot in his cheeks. “You haven’t got the conch,” he said.
Piggy	On the sand, even. We’d make smoke just the same.” “That’s right!” “Smoke!” “By the bathing pool!” The boys began to babble. Only [MASK] could have the intellectual daring to suggest moving the fire from the mountain.
Ralph	A flame, seemingly detached, swung like an acrobat and licked up the palm heads on the platform. The sky was black. The officer grinned cheerfully at [MASK]. “We saw your smoke. What have you been doing? Having a war or something?”
Ralph	[MASK] went on, abruptly. “But that’s littiuns’ talk. We’ll get that straight. So the last part, the bit we can all talk about, is kind of deciding on the fear.” The hair was creeping into his eyes again.
Ralph	“There’s pigs,” he said. “There’s food; and bathing water in that little stream along there—and everything. Didn’t anyone find anything else?” He handed the conch back to [MASK] and sat down.
Piggy	He spoke flatly. “I see.” The world, that understandable and lawful world, was slipping away. Once there was this and that; and now—and the ship had gone. The conch was snatched from his hands and [MASK]’s voice shrilled.
Ralph	I tell you what. He hates you too, [MASK]—” “Me? Why me?” “I dunno. You got him over the fire; an’ you’re chief an’ he isn’t.” “But he’s, he’s.
Ralph	“And then?” “I found a pig-run. It went for miles.” “So the pig-run must be somewhere in there.” [MASK] nodded. He pointed at the forest. Everybody agreed, sagely. “All right then.
Ralph	At last the assembly was silent again. Someone spoke out of turn. “Maybe he means it’s some sort of ghost.” [MASK] lifted the conch and peered into the gloom. The lightest thing was the pale beach. Surely the littluns were nearer?
Ralph	There was a shout from beyond the thicket and then [MASK] was running with the swiftness of fear through the undergrowth. He came to a pig-run, followed it for perhaps a hundred yards, and then swerved off.
Ralph	[MASK] went on. “We have lots of assemblies. Everybody enjoys speaking and being together. We decide things. But they don’t get done. We were going to have water brought from the stream and left in those coconut shells under fresh leaves.
Ralph	but I can hear.” The dispersed figures had come together on the sand and were a dense black mass that revolved. They were chanting something and littluns that had had enough were staggering away, howling. [MASK] raised the conch to his lips and then lowered it.
Ralph	“We were together then—” The officer nodded helpfully. “I know. Jolly good show. Like the Coral Island.” [MASK] looked at him dumbly. For a moment he had a fleeting picture of the strange glamour that had once invested the beaches.
Ralph	“Who’ll join my tribe?” “I will.” “Me.” “I will.” “I’ll blow the conch,” said [MASK] breathlessly, “and call an assembly.” “We shan’t hear it.”
Ralph	This palm trunk lay parallel to the beach, so that when [MASK] sat he faced the island but to the boys was a darkish figure against the shimmer of the lagoon. The two sides of the triangle of which the log was base were less evenly defined.
Simon	“I know that.” [MASK] discovered that he had spoken aloud. He opened his eyes quickly and there was the head grinning amusedly in the strange daylight, ignoring the flies, the spilled guts, even ignoring the indignity of being spiked on a stick.
Lydia	[MASK] swings the case—it contains a blazer, gym shoes as well as a load of books—onto her head. Sometimes they giggle and are in cahoots —Don’t tell you saw, hey Lydia—(When she has come from school on the back of a boy’s bicycle instead of safely by bus.)
Shylock	Everybody he’s like money. Of course—[MASK]’s gesture from a man so poor he had nothing to offer in the city but his own pound of flesh, and nothing else to gain there beyond money; money in the beggarly denominations a servant knows.
Mary	There were patterns made out of crying and knowledge and love and quarrelling. There was a pattern, or a person, for every piece of our lives. The house was polished and loved by my first mother [MASK] every day. And behind the house is where the dead are buried.
Russian	I think perhaps it’s time we gave him a bonus. He’s trying to compile a complete list for us of foreign agents here—American as well as [MASK]. Wild duck—that’s what he calls them.’ ‘It would be quite a coup.
Kidnapping	He was well, and so was she. Both were liberated, though she didn’t tell him where she’d spent the last three days. [MASK] wasn’t such a harsh ordeal after all, he joked. He had been treated superbly; not a single bruise.
Toby	“Looka here, he can talk! But I’m tellin’ you, boy, you got to forgit all dat African talk. Make white folks mad an’ scare niggers. Yo’ name [MASK]. Dey calls me Fiddler.” He pointed to himself.
Matthew	Was there anything in the Scriptures about chickens? Vaguely she recalled something—in [MASK], if she wasn’t mistaken—about “a hen gathereth her chickens beneath her wings ...” I must look that up, she told herself.
Kunta	“Four hundred!” “Five!” And the first toubob would shout: “Let’s hear six! Look at him! Works like a mule!” [MASK] shuddered with fear, his face running with sweat, breath tight in his throat.
Nadia	But [MASK] nodded. And while her eyes were warm, she did not smile. Refugees had occupied many of the open places in the city, pitching tents in the greenbelts between roads, erecting lean-tos next to the boundary walls of houses, sleeping rough on sidewalks and in the margins of streets.
Saeed	In the morning when he woke she was watching him and he stroked her hair and she touched his bristles above his lip and below his ear with her finger and he kissed her and things felt good between them. They packed up and [MASK] hef ted the large backpack and Nadia the tent
Spade	The fat man chuckled. “I palmed it?” “Yes,” [MASK] said, jingling the pistols in his hand. “Do you want to say so or do you waijj-to stand for a frisk?” “Stand for—?”
Spade	“There’s nothing funny about it.” [MASK] did not seem offended by the fat man’s laughter, nor in any way impressed. He spoke in the manner of one reasoning with a recalcitrant, but not altogether unreasonable, friend. “It’s our best bet.
Spade	The way to handle them is to toss them a victim, somebody they can hang the works on.” “Well, sir, I grant you that’s one way of doing it, but—” “ ‘But’ hell!” [MASK] said.
Sam	“You won’t do that for me?” “I won’t play the sap for you.” “Don’t say that, please.” She took his hand from her shoulder and held it to her face. “Why must you do this to me, [MASK]?
Spade	“It’s all right,” [MASK] assured him, giving h:m one of his cards. “If you want to play safe, though, we can ride up to your office and get your superintendent’s OK.” “I guess it’s all right.
Clarice	"All right, then tell me how—" "It's your turn to tell me, [MASK]. You don't have any beach vacations at the Hoof and Mouth Disease Station to offer me anymore. It's strictly quid pro quo from here on out.
Elijah	She moved to the closet with her usual quick, precise movements, pulled a shoebox out and handed it to [MASK]. “’Lijah, you still didn’t answer my question.” “What question was that, baby?” he asked, smiling up at her innocently.
Facebook	Something he wrote, rather: I read it on [MASK] that morning. It wasn’t a shock—I knew she was having a baby, he’d told me, and I’d seen her, seen that pink blind in the nursery window.
Tom	[MASK] told me, “It won’t always be like this, they’ll eventually upgrade the line and then it will be fast trains screaming past,” but I couldn’t believe it would ever actually happen. I would have stayed there, I would have bought him out if I’d had the money.
MUAD'DIB	And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear’s path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” What do you despise? By this are you truly known. — FROM "MANUAL OF [MASK]" BY THE PRINCESS iRULAN
Paul	His legs were remote and rubbery. They entered a narrow side passage, its walls dimly lighted by spaced-out glowglobes. [MASK] felt the drug beginning to have its unique effect on him, opening time like a flower.
Paul	And [MASK] knew his leadership suffered from the omnipresent knowledge of this difference between them. He had not ridden the maker. Oh, he’d gone up with the others for training trips and raids, but he had not made his own voyage.
Paul	“Now I say guard yourself for true!” He leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack. [MASK] fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as shield edges touched and repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact along his skin.
Paul	This is the only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.” [MASK] took a deep breath to still his trembling. “If I call out there’ll be servants on you in seconds and you’ll die.”
Paul	“Or our spice. You can be sure of that.” [MASK] glanced at the openings in the tunnel walls, seeing the heavy carpets on the raised ledge, glimpses of rooms with bright fabrics on the walls, piled cushions.
Stilgar	“At this distance we’re just a worm on the surface,” [MASK] said. He motioned with his left hand. “Off. Scatter on the sand.” The troop began working down the worm’s sides, dropping off, blending with the sand beneath their cloaks.
Paul	[MASK] glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted the character and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to his right, smaller to his left. Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one side up more frequently.
ADANO	He knew what to say A BELL FOR [MASK] when his Captain started lecturing on discipline. “Well, I got my orders,” the Captain said. “I got to go out and take the guards off the road by the bridge and the sulphur works.
Pisces	“February what?” “The twenty-second.” “Ah, a little fish, is it? [MASK]. We should do well together, me being a Scorpio. You should never marry a Virgo, by the way.
Tom	[MASK] followed him toward the door. ‘You know, your father’s very concerned about your coming home. He asked me to give you a good talking to, which of course I won’t, but I’ll still have to tell him something.
Tom	... If you really didn’t know that I had been by your hotel, that only means that [MASK] didn’t tell you, which leaves the same conclusion to be drawn. It’s pretty obvious now that you’re running out and can’t face me.
Tom	Why in hell hadn’t he put the rings somewhere else, like in the lining of that suitcase? ‘I don’t really know,’ [MASK] said. ‘A whim or something. You know how he is.
Tom	He stiffened, sensing danger. You’re not out of the woods yet, he told himself. You’re not out of the house yet. ‘Ready to go?’ [MASK] asked. ‘You do live here, don’t you?’ ‘No!’
Uncle	His whole face was red and immense, his breathing heavy. “Que yo te quiero. I love you, nephew. You understand?” “Yes, [MASK], is that why you told me to come here?”
Maria	“Dior mio, you’ve got to stop humiliating yourself this way.” (Then the voices went on until the last fading trumpet line of “Beautiful [MASK] of My Soul,” inhalation of a cigarette, sip of whiskey, and the record-player arm lifts up again.)
Maria	The next day, he went to [MASK]’s house and she was not there, and he went there the next day and she was not there, and then he went to the Havana Hilton and she was not there. What if something had happened to her?
Cuban	It goes all the way up.” They stood for a few minutes in silence, and then he asked her, “Are you [MASK]? j Tu eres cubana?" “Oh, yes, I am.” “I knew it.”
Revelation	He jangled his coin box and murmured in his husky, prayerful voice, “Give to the Lord. Give to the poor.” Whenever anyone looked at him suspiciously he quoted from [MASK], “ ‘That ye may eat the flesh of kings.’ ”
Baby	‘[MASK],’ I said to her. ‘You sure look good to me.’ She gave me a half-incredulous, half-hopeful look, and her red lips flowered in her dark face. ‘Are you kidding?’
Euphemia	The People gave her the name [MASK] or Euph-something, but when they called her that she used to toss her head like a horse and refuse to answer so they’d had to give up in the end and call her by her true-true name.
Yankees	These col’-blooded [MASK] can’t raise nuthin’ that looks like thet chile ; no, ’ndeed! ” Two or three of the young friends of the family who lived in the neighborhood had now arrived, and the conversation became very animated.
Lincoln	You’re jeopardizing the best chance you ever had since [MASK] issued the Emancipation Proclamation.” “ That’s all right. Promises are like pie-crust, made to be broken. You may be the best we can do, and the best is d-------- poor.
Job	Let me know your answer then.” And turning, he left her as abruptly as he had come. CHAPTER XXI. AFTER MANY DAYS. “ The Lord blessed the latter end of [MASK] more than his beginning.” The days dragged their weary length along.
Laila	As [MASK] reached for the curtains, she saw a car pass by on the street tailed by a cloud of dust. It was the blue Benz with the Herat license plate finally leaving. She followed it with her eyes until it vanished around a turn, its back window twinkling in the sun.
Maori	And I don’t think I’ll disclose meantime that I can speak [MASK]. “Kei whea te rini?” She stole a surreptitious glance. The boy flushed violently, reached for his back pocket, and then the colour drained out of his face.
Maori	E pai ana, e Kere, e pai ana.” “That’s okay,” but the thanks in [MASK] don’t, this time, draw the normal emotional response. He could be saying The moon, the moon, going by what she feels.
Janie	“Hello, [MASK], how you cornin’?” “Aw, pretty good, Ah’m tryin’ to soak some uh de tiredness and de dirt outa mah feet.” She laughed a little. “Ah see you is. Gal, you sho looks good.
Janie	“First thing, though, us got tuh eat together, [MASK]. Then we can talk.” “One thing, Ah won’t send you out after no fish.” He pinched her in the side and ignored what she said.
Janie	He held it up for a joke to tease [MASK] a little. “Looka heah, Brother Mayor, whut yo’ wife done took and done.” It was cut comical, so everybody laughed at it. “Uh woman and uh knife—no kind of uh knife, don’t b’long tuhgether.
Janie	But, don’t care how firm your determination is, you can’t keep turning round in one place like a horse grinding sugar cane. So [MASK] took to sitting over the room. Sit and look. The room inside looked like the mouth of an alligator—gaped wide open to swallow something down.
Janie	and it hurt me tuh mah heart tuh be ill treated lak Ah is.” The gun came up unsteadily but quickly and leveled at [MASK]’s breast. She noted that even in his delirium he took good aim. Maybe he would point to scare her, that was all.
Janie	A beating with the fist. [MASK] was halfway down the palm-lined walk before she had a thought for her safety. Maybe this strange man was up to something! But it was no place to show her fear there in the darkness between the house and the store.
Janie	And Ah can’t die easy thinkin’ maybe de menfolks white or black is makin’ a spit cup outa you: Have some sympathy fuh me. Put me down easy, [MASK], Ah’m a cracked plate.” There are years that ask questions and years that answer.
Janie	Every tear you drop squeezes a cup uh blood outa mah heart. Ah got tuh try and do for you befo’ mah head is cold.” A sobbing sigh burst out of [MASK]. The old woman answered her with little soothing pats of the hand.
Janie	But you ain’t goin’ off in all dat mess uh commonness. Ah’m surprised at yuh fuh askin’.” He wiped his lips of ham gravy and put on his hat. “Shet de door behind yuh, [MASK].
Janie	“Don’t think Ah don’t feel wid you, [MASK], ’cause Ah do. Ah couldn’t love yuh no more if Ah had uh felt yo’ birth pains mah-self. Fact uh de matter, Ah loves yuh a whole heap
Janie	“Yeah, Ah’m nearly forty and you’se already fifty. How come you can’t talk about dat sometimes instead of always pointin’ at me?” “T’ain’t no use in gettin’ all mad, [MASK], ’cause Ah mention you ain’t no young gal
Cake	You see dese no count niggers come in heah and break up mah place! How kin you set and see yo’ wife all trompled on? You ain’t no kinda man at all. You seen dat Tea [MASK] shove me down! Yes you did!
Janie	G’bye.” He almost ran out of the door. [MASK] hung over the newel post thinking so long that she all but went to sleep there. However, before she went to bed she took a good look at her mouth, eyes and hair.
Janie	“So Ah thought Ah mout as well go see.” He tagged on and swallowed to kill time but [MASK] said nothing except, “Ah’ll cut de p’taters fuh yuh. When yuh cornin’ back?” “Don’t know exactly. Round dust dark
Janie	De boogerman liable tuh tote yuh off whilst Ah’m gone.” “’Tain’t no boogerman got me tuh study ’bout. Maybe you think Ah ain’t treatin’ yuh right and you watchin’ me.” “Naw, naw, [MASK]. Ah know better’n dat.
Janie	“De mayor of uh town lak dis can’t lay round home too much. De place needs buildin’ up. [MASK], Ah’ll git hold uh somebody tuh help out in de store and you kin look after things whilst Ah drum up things otherwise.”
Janie	Lemme know when dat ole pee-de-bed is gone and Ah’ll be right back.” Six months of wearing black passed and not one suitor had ever gained the house porch. [MASK] talked and laughed in the store at times, but never seemed to want to go further.
Janie	You oughta be glad, ’cause dat makes uh big woman outa you.” A feeling of coldness and fear took hold of her. She felt far away from things and lonely. [MASK] soon began to feel the impact of awe and envy against her sensibilities.
Janie	It was time to bury the dead. “[MASK], us been in dis dirty, slouchy place two days now, and dat’s too much. Us got tuh git outa dis house and outa dis man’s town. Ah never did lak round heah.”
Janie	“Don’t keer how big uh lie get told, somebody kin b’lieve it!” They fought on. “You done hurt mah heart, now you come wid uh lie tuh bruise mah ears! Turn go mah hands!” [MASK] seethed.
Bernard	“You don’t mean to say . . . ?” “Why not? [MASK]’s an Alpha Plus. Besides, he asked me to go to one of the Savage Reservations with him. I’ve always wanted to see a Savage Reservation.”
Lenina	The slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, neo-Pavlovian conditioning and hypnopxdia ...” And round her waist she wore a silver-mounted green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt, bulging (for [MASK] was not a freemartin) with the regulation supply of contraceptives.
Linda	“Now children!” she called. [MASK] had stirred uneasily, had opened her eyes for a moment, looked vaguely around, and then once more dropped off to sleep. Sitting beside her, the Savage tried hard to recapture his mood of a few minutes before.
Bernard	To have dealings with members of the lower castes was always, for [MASK], a most distressing experience. For whatever the cause (and the current gossip about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate may very likely—for accidents will happen—have been true)
Bernard	I only said it was lovely here because . . . well, because progress is lovely, isn’t it?” “Five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen,” said [MASK] wearily, as though to himself. “What did you say?”
Bernard	“It’s more like a caffeine-solution party than a trial,” he said, and let himself fall into the most luxurious of the pneumatic arm-chairs. “Cheer up, [MASK],” he added, catching sight of his friend’s green unhappy face.
Bernard	In the end [MASK] had to slink back, diminished, to his rooms and inform the impatient assembly that the Savage would not be appearing that evening. The news was received with indignation. The men were furious at having been tricked into behaving politely to this insignificant fellow with the unsavoury reputation and the heretical opinions.
Ford	True, ideas were beginning to change even then. Our [MASK] himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. Mass production demanded the shift. Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning; truth and beauty can’t.
Ford	Boys at one with girls at peace; Orgy-porgy gives release. ” “Orgy-porgy,” the dancers caught up the liturgical refrain, “Orgy-porgy, [MASK] and fun, kiss the girls ...”
Bernard	“Yes, I can,” [MASK] answered in a very loud voice. Somewhat taken aback, but still majestically, “Then show it,” said the Director. “Certainly. But it’s in the passage. One moment.”
Bernard	“I know,” said [MASK], interrupting him. “I was talking to his fordship on the phone a moment ago.” His bored tone implied that he was in the habit of talking to his fordship every day of the week. He dropped into a chair.
Bernard	to kiss, slobberingly, and smelt too horrible, obviously never had a bath, and simply reeked of that beastly stuff that was put into Delta and Epsilon bottles (no, it wasn’t true about [MASK]), positively stank of alcohol.
Kahu	The skin felt like very smooth, slippery rubber. Without really thinking about it, [MASK] began to stroke the whale just behind the fin. It is my lord, the whale rider. She felt a tremor in the whale and a rippling under the skin.
Kahu	She raised her head and began to call to the whale. The wind snatched at her words and flung them with the foam to smash in the wind. [MASK] tried again. “Oh, sacred ancestor," she called. “I am coming to you.
Jonah	I panicked and I lost sight of her, and I thought that she had been swept into the whales huge mouth. I was almost sick thinking about it, but then I remembered that [MASK] had lived on in the belly of his whale.
Paikea	She looked up at [MASK]. "He’s not ready yet,” she said. The sea seemed to be trembling with anticipation. Haumi e, hui e, taiki e. Let it be done. WINTER Wkale Song, Whale Rider FOURTEEN
Kahu	Ko Paikea? By chance, [MASK] felt the whales forward fin. Her fingers tightened quickly around it. She held on for dear life. And the whale felt a surge of gladness that as it mounted became ripples of ecstasy, ever increasing.
Hitler	If [MASK] had had things his way, we'd just be slaves now. The whole world would be a few masters and millions upon millions of slaves. And I don't need to remind anyone here, there's no dignity to be had in being a slave.
Stevens	Coming out of the blue as it did, I did not quite know how to reply to such a suggestion. I recall thanking him for his consideration, but quite probably I said nothing very definite, for my employer went on: 'I'm serious, [MASK].
Jack	And I just don’t see how I can do it on my own.” He walked out, but kept himself from slamming the door. irp- Even as a boy [MASK] had loved the smell of the ground softening in the thaw and coming back to life.
Jack	And even if we did fall through, this isn’t the main channel. The water’s only a foot deep. We’d just get cold and wet, but even that won’t happen. I promise. [MASK] put on his own skates and led them onto the ice.
Jack	Then, as she broke through the trees and out into the yard, she heard it clearly—laughter. [MASK] and the child stood side by side, their arms outstretched and hands nearly touching. Then, without warning, they threw themselves backward into the deep snow.
Life	Why does it always have to be somebody’s fault?” “Because it always is.” “No. Sometimes these things happen. [MASK] doesn’t go the way we plan or hope, but we don’t have to be so angry, do we?”
Dracula	I don’t do that kind of stuff with boys. But even the Black girls I know that lay all the way down, they don’t get up with that boy’s toothprints on their neck. Some of the girls around this school look like [MASK] been biting on them.
Eleanor	“It’s the house. I think it’s biding its time.” “Waiting until we feel secure, maybe, and then it will pounce.” “I winder how long it can wait.” [MASK] shivered and started up the great staircase.
Christian	“I don’t. That’s the point. I feel about punishment the way you feel about my touching you.” His entire demeanor changes in a nanosecond. Gone is playful [MASK], and he stands staring at me as if I’ve slapped him.
Christian	My eyes flicker unwillingly open for a split second. I’m in bed and someone is nuzzling my ear. “Wake up, baby,” he whispers, and the effect of his sweet voice spreads like warm melted caramel through my veins. It's [MASK].
Christian	“They need lubrication. Suck,” he orders, his voice soft. The balls are cold, smooth, surprisingly heavy, and metallic tasting. My dry mouth pools with saliva as my tongue explores the unfamiliar objects. [MASK]’s gaze does not leave mine.
Christian	I shatter again into tiny fragments, and [MASK] stills, finally letting go, silently finding his release. He collapses on top of me, breathing hard. “How nice was that?” he asks through his gritted teeth. Oh my.
Christian	“So, you’re mad at me for having dinner with an old friend.” [MASK] turns his burning, wary gaze to me, lifting my hand to his lips and kissing each knuckle gently. Jeez, he wants to do this now?
Christian	I need a plan. I head back to watch [MASK] move gracefully around his kitchen. “The NDA, does it cover everything?” I ask tentatively. “Why?” He turns and gazes at me while putting the Twinings away. I flush.
Christian	Jeez . . . get a room. I stare at my feet, embarrassed. I glance up at [MASK], and he’s watching me intently. I narrow my eyes at him. Why can’t you kiss me like that?
Christian	The problem is, I just want [MASK], not all his... baggage—and right now he has a 747 cargo hold’s worth of baggage. Could I just lie back and embrace it? Like a submissive? I’ve said I’d try.
Christian	“Well?” she prompts, and squeezes my hand. “His name’s [MASK]. He’s beyond handsome. He’s wealthy . . . too wealthy. He’s very complicated and mercurial.” Yes—I feel inordinately pleased with my concise, accurate summary.
Christian	I put the bacon under the grill, and while it’s cooking, I whisk some eggs. I turn, and [MASK] is sitting on one of the barstools at the breakfast bar, leaning on it, his face supported by his stee-pled hands.
Christian	“[MASK]. You just don’t fight fair.” “I know. I never have.” My inner goddess frowns at me. You can do this, she coaxes—-play this sex god at his own game. Can I? Okay. What to do?
Christian	His cool fingers trail languidly across my belly. My skin is oversensitive, my hips flex automatically, and the now-warmer liquid from my navel seeps over my belly. [MASK] moves quickly, lapping it up with his tongue, kissing, biting me softly, sucking.
Christian	It’s wonderful to see you.” And with that loving statement, she leaves. Hmm, [MASK] and reasonable . . . two concepts that I thought were mutually exclusive, but after his e-mail, maybe all things are possible. I shake my head.
Anastasia	“That’s damned cheeky, coming from you.” He leans across and kisses the tip of my nose. “This will shock you, [MASK]. Ready?” I nod, wide-eyed, still with the stupid grin on my face.
Christian	I turn back to face [MASK]. We are four feet apart. He steps forward, and instinctively I step back. He stops, and the anguish in his expression is palpable, his gray eyes burning. “I don’t want you to go,” he murmurs, his voice full of longing.
Christian	Holy crap . . . this is the tricky part. He refills my teacup, and I sip. “So, what’s your general attitude to receiving pain?” [MASK] looks expectantly at me. “You’re biting your lip,” he says darkly.
Napoleon	Didn’t every soldier in the armies of [MASK] feel that there was a Marshal’s baton in his knapsack? Wasn’t that one of the things that made the little emperor great? He didn’t have to let others find him leaders. He found them himself.
Gray	With the bells it reminded her of—oh yes—[MASK]’s “Elegy”— though, of course, that was English. The curfew tolls the knell of parting day. There was no church in sight, but from somewhere these bells were ringing a curfew.
Confucius	“Men are all alike, beasts.” An old man in bifocals retorted, “A woman shouldn’t be allowed to divorce either, or else there’ll be disorder everywhere. The order of the world is rooted in every family, as [MASK] said.”
Bath	Never in my life had anyone loved me so selflessly, as the hag in the Wife of [MASK]’s Tale had loved her fickle knight, but despite this remarkable love, I was not, as I say, ready for marriage.
Cat	I said nothing. “[MASK] got your tongue?” She grinned. “She always used to wish she had it.” I looked away from her at the traffic light. She was standing close to the building and I was standing out on the sidewalk.
Rider	I guess he must’ve been wearing his Dick Tracy coat then. Yeah, if I was an outsider I probably would’ve laughed too. I just stood there trying not to let my embarrassment show in my voice. I sang “See See [MASK].”
Elvis	But then in some of them documentaries you got the King saying that his style of singing was influenced by listening to black people’s music. Of course they don’t mention the colored people every time they mention [MASK].
Shakespeare	I mean, the poet. Naw, not [MASK]. He knows what a man wants, and what a man thinks a woman wants, even the best of women. He’s good at portraying bitches, but even they’re a man’s idea of a bitch.
Han	“Okay, what’s going on around here, anyway?” [MASK] was instantly back on track. Here was unbelievably good fortune—here was someone he could make a plan with. And not only someone, but his most loyal friend in the galaxy.
Leia	Her movement was away from the Ewok, who, like a skittish puppy, took this as a safe sign and followed her to the wreckage. [MASK] picked the Imperial scout’s laser pistol off the ground; it was all that was left of him.
Luke	[MASK] stared at his father’s twitching, severed, mechanical hand—and then at his own black-gloved artificial part—and realized suddenly just how much he’d become like his father. Like the man he hated.
Luke	With her second shot she wiped out the first deck gun. The explosions rocked the great barge, momentarily distracting the five guards who surrounded [MASK]. In that moment he reached out his hand, and the light-saber, lying on the deck ten feet away, flew into it.
Endor	His specialty was Imperial defense procedures. He raised his fin and pointed at the holographic model of the force field emanating from [MASK]. “Although uncompleted, the Death Star is not entirely without a defense mechanism,” he instructed in soothing Calamarian tones.
Romans	He picked up the Bible, began to read the Twelfth Chapter of [MASK], more to the Claffey taste. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love. . . rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer.
Satan	Had enough of prayers when I was little. I speak now from the Larger Catechism: We are by nature children of Wrath, bond slaves to [MASK], and justly liable to all punishments in this world and that which is to come.
Nancy	[MASK] took them aside. She had a flat solemn pleasant face. The Blacksmith brothers could hear what she told them. •e two fellers pretty bloody tough, cut yer water off y throat like as not. You git off with yer into bush -.uu catch possum a few hours.
Rockefeller	“I don’t think so much of these Oysters [MASK]. 1 don’t see why we didn’t order tomato soup instead.” “Well, about a million other people like them, even if you don’t. Presidents and folks like that too!
Mary	“Hail [MASK], full of grace, the Lord is with Thee,” she began, over and over again, very softly, so that she would not disturb her husband, who was slumbering beside her. Yet she could not complete the simple formula.
David	“It’s nice, isn’t it, that [MASK] should be so fond of his stepfather? I didn’t think people were, usually. And it’s nice, too, that his mother should be so happy in her second marriage.
Colonel	Sly and not to be trusted and you could never read their faces. “I don’t like to sound immodest, [MASK]. The major can speak more objectively.” The major cleared his throat and spoke in a flat voice.
Harry	I ran through the arch and stopped there with my mouth open. Based on [MASK]’s theme, I had always assumed that I’d have to stop a man swinging the sort of hammer guys kept in their toolboxes. That wasn’t what he had.
Eddie	Then she was in darkness, alone with the sound of the falling web and [MASK]’s simple moveless weight. She didn’t want to let him go, didn’t want to let his face lie on the foul floor of this place.
Pharaoh	And your father is giving a sermon about [MASK]’s army and the plagues. Everyone is all right.” I squatted low with my chin on my knees and watched my bare feet change slowly from dark auburn, to speckled, to white as the ants dispersed and forayed out into the bottom of the canoe.
Noah	That particular combination stands as one chance in seven, by the way. It should occur on average seven times per year, separated by intervals just slightly longer than that endured by [MASK] on his putative ark. Was this blue-moon event special to our neighbors?
Bangala	He throws back his head and shouts these words to the sky, while his lambs sit scratching themselves in wonder. [MASK] means something precious and dear. But the way he pronounces it, it means the poisonwood tree.
Jack	But the manager takes care of his help. He finds that it pays. Education always pays, don’t you agree, sir?” “Yes,” [MASK] said dazedly. “For instance, you show a great interest in learning more about the Overlook Hotel.
Jack	He would be careful. He would watch for something called Redrum. But he would not say anything unless he absolutely had to. Because they were happy, they had been laughing, and there were no bad thoughts. “Look at this view,” [MASK] said.
Jack	Like from a long time ago. In my head.” The elevator car stopped again. The hotel was silent, creaking, deserted. Outside, the wind whined around the eaves in the darkness. “Maybe you are both crazy,” [MASK] said conversationally.
Curiosity	He was scared that he had taken the passkey again, disobeying his father. He had wanted to come here. [MASK] (killed the cat; satisfaction brought him back) was like a constant fishhook in his brain, a kind of nagging siren song that would not be appeased.
Travis	Getting to his feet, [MASK] said, “What is it, boy? What’s got your tail in an uproar?” The retriever jumped onto its hind feet, put his forepaws on one of the shelves, and sniffed the spines of the books.
Dracula	and I saw the small white scar I had already noticed many times. “I knew in my bones that [MASK] had not forgotten about me, and that he might search for me again. I filled my pockets with garlic and my mind with strength.
Shah	Checkmate, I think you say in English. [MASK] is the word for king. A batde of kings.’ “I watched the two men beginning their game, their gnarled fingers selecting the first warriors. Jokes flashed between them — probably they were old friends.
Dracula	My blood had already non cold in every extremity. ‘This book was like no other, an empty book, very old, with a dragon in the middle and a word — drakulya. I had never heard about [MASK] before. But the picture was very strange and strong.
Daisy	“No, let me tell you the rest,” [MASK] said, holding herself away stiffly. “Ever since, ever since I got away from him I’ve refused to answer his letters. Finally, I wouldn’t even read his letters—that’s why my money was all lost I think.
Daisy	[MASK] seemed to be utterly comfortable looking idly around the room, without making any attempt to talk to him. Why didn’t she chatter, why didn’t she flirt, why didn’t she try to get him to talk about himself like any other decent, self-respecting woman?
Mariama	Relatives bring us news of her.” Curious about Senegalese marital customs, I asked, “Is it still common for a man to have more than one wife?” “It is not uncommon,” said [MASK].
Buck	“When I come back down, be close by. We may have to take up arms.” “Arms?” [MASK] said. “I heard about those. Count me out.” “You may change your mind if the GC opens fire.”
Buck	All [MASK] knew was that what he had endured in three and a half years was a walk in the park compared to what was coming. The entire drive back he spent in silent prayer for every loved one and Trib Force member.
Michael	Our general is better than your general, he thought, so game over. That almost made him smile. Why should he worry about the people who held him now when [MASK] the archangel could step in and make them faint dead away—if they were lucky?
Portuguese	My fathers tale ended at the moment when his arm was being severed and he lost consciousness. Now he smiled grimly and pointed the stem of his pipe toward me. My son, he said, this country is besieged by Castilians in the north and [MASK] in the west.
John	She hadn’t raised her head, but her manner had changed. She seemed more at ease. "Tis a good chapter,’ she said, ‘[MASK] 14. Let not your heart be troubled.’ She had taken the pen from the table.
John	“What would you have done?” [MASK] said. “Hired a rainmaker? Got the ministers to pray or the Indians from the mountain to dance for clouds?” “I don’t believe it has to be this bad,” I said.
Moses	That’s [MASK] in the bulrushes.” “You don’t mind, do you, that I’m going away?” she asked wistfully, looking up into his face. But his face was inscrutable, under the heavy brows. He kept it quite blank.
Birds	“Perhaps I can just go down the close with you.” They went down the poor, rabbit-bitten pasture. [MASK] were whistling in wild evening triumph in the wood. A man was calling up the last cows, which trailed slowly over the path-wom pasture.
Scout	“Don’t you touch him!” I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was surprised to see him fall back in real pain. I intended to kick his shin, but aimed too high. “That’ll do. [MASK].”
Mockingbirds	“Your father’s right,” she said. “[MASK] don’t do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in comcribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.
Atticus	“If you’ll concede the necessity of going to school, we’ll go on reading every night just as we always have. Is it a bargain?” “Yes sir!” “We’ll consider it sealed without the usual formality,” [MASK] said, when he saw me preparing to spit.
Hitler	Well anyway, [MASK]’s started a program to round up all the half-Jews too and he wants to register ’em in case they might wanta cause him any trouble and I think this is a bad thing and that’s my current event.”
Jem	They’re ugly, but those are the facts of life.” “Doesn’t make it right,” said [MASK] stolidly. He beat his fist softly on his knee. “You just can’t convict a man on evidence like that—you can’t.”
Jem	It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived. The day after [MASK]’s twelfth birthday his money was burning up his pockets, so we headed for town in the early afternoon.
Tom	He seemed to be a respectable Negro, and a respectable Negro would never go up into somebody’s yard of his own volition. ‘[MASK], what happened to you on the evening of November twenty-first of last year?”
Atticus	“Do what? Put him under a peace bond?” “When a man says he’s gonna get you, looks like he means it.” “He meant it when he said it,” said [MASK].
Atticus	They persisted in pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much [MASK] could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was probably the beginning of my father’s profound distaste for the practice of criminal law.
Scout	If there’s just one kind of folks, why can’t they get along with each other? If they’re all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? [MASK], I think I’m beginning to understand something.
Atticus	[MASK]’s fingers went to his watchpocket. “No it didn’t,” he said, more to himself than to us. “That was the one thing that made me think, well, this may be the shadow of a beginning. That jury took a few hours.
Atticus	“Easy does it, son,” [MASK] would say. “She’s an old lady and she’s ill. You just hold your head high and be a gentleman. Whatever she says to you, it’s your job not to let her make you mad.”
Atticus	Cry about the hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think that they’re people, too.” “[MASK] says cheatin’ a colored man is ten times worse than cheatin’ a white man,” I muttered.
Boo	I never saw him again. Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. [MASK] was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives.
Mary	“Its fleece was white as snow!” “Once four is four. Once five is five. Once six is six.” “And everywhere that [MASK] went the lamb was sure to go!” “Once seven is seven. Once eight is eight.
Einstein	“What’s E = me2?” “[MASK]’s equation.” “What’s E stand for?” “Energy.” “m?” “Mass.” «c2?>> “The square of the velocity of light in centimeters per second.”
Meg	“The virtue is gone from them. And what I have to give you this time you must try to understand not word by word, but in a flash, as you understand the tesseract. Listen, [MASK]. Listen well.
Meg	“But I’m not patient!” [MASK] cried passionately. “I’ve never been patient!” ‘Mrs. Who’s glasses shone at her gently. “If you want to help your father then you must learn patience.
Michelangelo	It was the first time the Sistine Chapel had been opened to the public and she was inspecting the ceiling on a new elevator that carried the visitor through the chapel horizontally, making it possible to see the frescoes exactly as [MASK], painting them, had seen them.
Guy	“It smells,” she said. “There’s stuff in it called tannis root.” She held out her hand. “From the famous greenhouse.” [MASK] smelled and shrugged. “It’s not bad,” he said.
Carol	“When you’ve got the kids down, why don’t you come over and have a cup of coffee with me?” “Thanks, I’d like to,” [MASK] said, “but I have to wax the family-room floor.”
Joanna	[MASK] watched her and shook her head. They never stop, these Stepford wives, she thought. It sounded like the first line of a poem. They never stop, these Stepford wives. They something something all their lives. Work like robots.
Joanna	Like an actress in a commercial. That’s what she was, [MASK] felt suddenly. That’s what they all were, all the Stepford wives: actresses in commercials, pleased with detergents and floor wax, with cleansers, shampoos, and deodorants.
Elmer	[MASK] is a born preacher, once he lets himself go, and I can make him do it! O Lord, how mysterious are thy ways! Thou hast chosen to train our young brother not so much in prayer as in the mighty struggles of the Olympic field!
Reverend	He was light-footed still, for all his weight, and there was electricity' in his grasp as his hands curled about his partner’s waist. “Oh, my. [MASK], if you hadn’t been a preacher you’d have been some dancing-man!”
Charlie	And he never knew that it was only so that she and a saxaphone player could gaze at one another. But [MASK] is such a sweet boy that he hardly ever seems to notice what is going on, even when he is not drinking.
Dorothy	But [MASK]’s poverty always seems to consist in not worrying about bills, so she went right on, as usual, spending most of her time in the lobby of the Algonquin hotel, becoming more and more of a chum to the elevater boy.
Madame	He’ll catch up with her on the Grande-Rue, and if [MASK] of the long tongue from next door was watching to see anything she could see—for her eyes are as sharp as her tongue is long—she will be disappointed.”
Indians	Skip drunks. Stay out of clinkers; avoid Mexicans and [MASK]. How had she learned the rules? Seemed to her she had always known them. She asked if he was interested in some action and if it was worth twenty-five bucks to him.
Balzac	He had owed a clothing bill for two years, and then there was a set of [MASK]’s Human Comedy and a special edition of the unabridged Arabian Nights and some other similar items purchased from a book agent, and a typewriter and a camera.
Johnson	The cloth had absorbed the perspiration with its slight odor of curdled milk, as well as the staleness of the [MASK]’s Baby Powder caked in the creases of baby fat, and had begun to smell. It needed to be stripped, given a sponge off, then patted dry, oiled and freshly powdered.
Susan	—[MASK] Sontag 1 On an old-fashioned buffet in the main room of the house lay the sacred elements: a lighted candle in a holder and, next to it on a plate, a roasted ear of com fresh from the harvest.
Arya	[MASK] thrust her wooden sword through her belt and began to climb, leaping from cask to cask until she could reach the window. Grasping the stone with both hands, she pulled herself up. The wall was three feet thick, the window a tunnel slanting up and out.
Arya	only that would take her right past the barracks of the gold cloaks. She couldn't go that way. [MASK] tried to think of another way. If she crossed to the other side of the castle, she could creep along the river wall and through the little godswood . . .
Catelyn	He can see to your man's hurts." [MASK] had more faith in a maester's learning than a septon's prayers. She was about to say as much when she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either side of them.
Jon	He could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow [MASK] knew that if it fell, the world fell with it. "Makes you wonder what lies beyond," a familiar voice said.
Tyrion	There are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs, and 1 have seen darker shapes in my dreams." "In your dreams," [MASK] echoed, thinking how badly he needed another strong drink.
Jaime	[MASK] wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion's head.
Syrio	“Feat cuts deeper than swords, ” she said aloud, but it was no good pretending to be a water dancer, [MASK] had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed him, and anyhow she was only a little girl with a wooden stick, alone and afraid.
Bran	he heard his own voice saying, small and far away. And his father's voice replied to him. "That is the only time a man can be brave." Now, [MASK], the crow urged. Choose. Fly or die.
Ned	The look [MASK] gave her was anguished. "You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for him at court. A boy with a bastard's name . . . you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned."
Bran	and night, howling. Every time they chase it away, it returns. The maester said they closed the window once, to shut out the noise, and [MASK] seemed to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger." The queen shuddered.
Daenerys	but 1 can." He laid the point of his sword between [MASK]'s breasts and slid it downward, over the curve of her belly. "I want what I came for," he told her. "I want the crown he promised me.
Wolves	He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if it had a will of its own. "[MASK] have claws, as much as bears."
Robert	The king scrawled his signature blindly, leaving a smear of blood across the letter. "The seal should be witnessed." "Serve the boar at my funeral feast," [MASK] rasped. "Apple in its mouth, skin seared crisp. Eat the bastard.
Water	It left snow nearly a foot high in every direction. A warm snap followed for a day, melting some of the snow, then a deep freeze came. Ice on trees was two inches thick. [MASK] froze in canteens by morning.
Tom	She feels as if she has been nailed to the floor, but one of the nephews strides across the room. He has something of the petulant college boy about him, chubby face, a white shirt, a blue blazer, a red handkerchief in the breast pocket. —[MASK], he says.
Beethoven	Or: Watch me smile. He said it was like being [MASK] after scribbling the Ninth. He’d be out on a nice stroll in the countryside and suddenly all the sheet music was blowing away in the wind. He sat rooted to the chair and stared at his machine.
Meggie	They took no notice of [MASK] as she stood crying; it did not occur to her to seek help, for in the Cleary family those who could not fight their own battles got scant aid or sympathy, and that went for girls, too.
Meggie	“Well, children, are we not honored? Another Cleary in our school, and she cannot wait to broadcast her name!” She turned back to [MASK]. “Stand up when I address you, you ignorant little savage! And hold out your hands, please.”
Lord	We shall pray now, and I shall add the Rose to my prayers for the rest of my life. Our Dear [MASK] sends us many griefs and much pain during our progress to eternal life. We must learn to bear it, I as much as you.”
Frank	“A cup of tea? Very good idea.” The Cleary men came into the room together, and that was very hard, for they hadn’t forgiven him at all. [MASK] knew why; it was the way he had hurt their mother.
Meggie	He watched [MASK] as she stood on the front veranda, peering up the track toward Drogheda big house. “She’s so pretty, your daughter. I have a fondness for titian hair, you know. Hers would have sent the artist running for his brushes.
Jack	[MASK] said, “None taken,” but his jaw was clenched. “And he’s in negotiations to purchase another vessel.” The two men exchanged looks of surprise. The smaller man laughed, “I’ve got to give it to him, he’s got heart.”
Victoria	"I hope it fits,” she said. “If you were my size, I could’ve given you a whole drawerful of this shit. I damn near own [MASK]’s Secret.” “Don’t tell me you don’t wear it?”
Scots	She was a Scot, after all, and [MASK] were regarded by many as cold, proud people. And although she was proud to be a Scot, under no circumstances did she want these people—her people—to mistakenly think she was unapproachable.
Sarhili	Although [MASK] was chief of the amaGcaleka clan, he was recognized as the king of all the clans of the amaXhosa. Even those amaXhosa who lived in the lands that were now under British rule paid allegiance to him. When he showed great interest in the prophecies, many amaXhosa people followed him.
Jews	“Look at this rusty knife and these awls cleansed of blood with this rag, and now deny these instruments were used by you and your gang of [MASK] to perforate and bleed the body of a sweet and innocent Christian child!” The fixer forced himself to look.
Man	I can’t say he left us, though, for his fixation on the Remittance [MASK] remained. We used to say, “Who do you suppose that guy actually was?” We never found out. We found no shred of evidence that pointed to anything but a thoroughly prosaic Englishman.
Virginians	“I suppose that’s right,” she said. “I sometimes see the next fifty years as a protracted effort by the South to reestablish its leadership of the nation. We Carolinians and [MASK] aren’t powerful enough to do it by ourselves.
Moses	As a result the Talmud would constitute an inexhaustible source of wisdom which men could study all the days of their lives, still finding rewards even if they lived, like [MASK], to be a hundred and twenty. One day in the year 335
Moses	And I’m particularly covered by this injunction. Here [MASK] surely had me in mind: “And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house . .
Satan	Should earth against my soul engage, and hellish darts be hurled, Then I can smile at [MASK]’s rage and face a frowning world. “Let cares like a wild deluge come, and storms of sorrow fall; May I but safely reach my home, my God, my heaven, my all.
Tesla	[MASK] told me that he chose not to marry. He said love could be all right for working people, and maybe also for poets and artists, but not for inventors like him, who had to use all their passion for invention.
Topsy	[MASK], the elephant in question, was a disgruntled circus and work animal who had suffered the pains of forced labor, captivity, neglect and abuse. She had responded by killing three men, the last of whom fed her a burning cigarette.
Scarlett	It's a poor person and a poor nation that sits down and cries because life isn't precisely what they expected it to be. Why don't you pick up some enterprising Carpetbagger to work for you, [MASK]? The woods are full of them, God knows.'
Scarlett	'How closely women clutch the very chains that bind them! You think the Hindu custom barbarous—but would you have had the courage to appear here tonight if the Confederacy hadn't needed you?' Arguments of this character were always confusing to [MASK].
Tara	And I'm going to have pretty clothes and all of them are going to be silk—' 'All?' 'All' she said shortly, not even troubling to blush at his implication. I'm going to have money enough so the Yankees can never take [MASK] away from me.
Scarlett	The mask was gone. 'You must not say these things, [MASK]! You mustn't. You don't mean them. You'll hate yourself for saying them, and you'll hate me for hearing them!' She jerked her head away.
Scarlett	'I don't know. But don't look so frightened, [MASK]. Our charming new governor is a good friend of mine. It's just that times are too uncertain now and I don't want much of my money tied up in real estate.'
Scarlett	[MASK] stood on the landing and peered cautiously over the banisters into the hall below. It was empty. From the bedrooms on the floor above came an unending hum of low voices, rising and falling, punctuated with squeaks of laughter and, 'Now, you didn't, really!'
Scarlett	Just tell him politely but firmly that his presence and his disloyal talk are distinctly unwelcome at your house.' By this time [MASK] was boiling, ready to rear like a horse at the touch of a strange rough hand on its bridle. But she was afraid to speak.
Sethe	“Milk.” “You one mess.” [MASK] looked down at her stomach and touched it. The baby was dead. She had not died in the night, but the baby had. If that was the case, then there was no stopping now.
Sethe	The road curved like an elbow, and as he approached it he heard the singers before he saw them. When the women assembled outside 124, [MASK] was breaking a lump of ice into chunks. She dropped the ice pick into her apron pocket to scoop the pieces into a basin of water.
Sethe	So [MASK] and the girl Denver did what they could, and what the house permitted, for her. Together they waged a perfunctory battle against the outrageous behavior of that place; against turned-over slop jars, smacks on the behind, and gusts of sour air.
Sethe	“Running,” [MASK] told her. It was the first word she had spoken all day and it came out thick because of her tender tongue. “Them the feet you running on? My Jesus my.”
Pilate	“I thought you were him. I thought you came back to see me. Where is he? My Macon?” “Back home. He’s alive. He told me about you. . . .” “And [MASK]. Where is she?”
Jack	He tried the other and found it also. Slowly he directed one hand toward the cup and, just as he was about to spread his fingers, they began to grow in higgledy-piggledy fashion like [MASK]’s beanstalk all over the tray and the bed.
Mouse	[MASK] leaned forward to put his hand on my knee. It felt good to be alive and to be able to feel another mans touch. “I think you an’ me deserve a little sumpin’ fo’ all this mess, don’t you, Easy?”
Aborigines	‘I know they will. All my work will be ruined. I must formulate some plan. Let’s go back. Hurry.’ They retraced their steps and arrived back at the camp site to find it occupied. A fire was blazing and [MASK] were roasting a kangaroo.
Cadillacs	Went all through the thing like I was runnin’ drugs or something.” “You know a nigger ain’t s’posed to drive no Cadillac,” the round-faced man yelled from the table. “White folks have always been suspicious of niggers that be drivin’ [MASK].
Jackie	“He knew what he was doing. He knew that if he fought back..., well, put it this way, niggers didn’t live long back in those days if they fought back at the wrong time. Besides, [MASK] wanted to play baseball.
Jackie	“[MASK] was great, but there were so many others who didn’t get a chance at all.” “Who you tellin’?” the barber said. “Ain’t I seen some of those Negro League teams play?
Jackie	I remember where they threw black cats out on the field and called him nigger and stuff like that. He had guts.” The barber clicked off his clippers and offered, “Base runners used to slide into second base with their spikes up when [MASK] was on the bag.
Grandma	“You here visiting your folks?” she asked, and her eyes went opaque like dried drops of milk. “No..., I mean, yes, ma’am. [MASK] and grandpa, you know,” he said and waddled backwards away from the cold stare.
Sirens	[MASK] were screaming all around, and the rush of people towards the tragedy had not abated. From the kitchen he heard the women talking, rerunning old horror stories. “Ain’t the first time a baby’s been killed or hurt.
Jackie	But [MASK] took it. Didn’t start no trouble. Just kept quiet and played the best damn baseball white folks had ever seen.” “He didn’t do nothin’?” the lean man in the felt hat gasped. “He didn’t fight back?”
Izzy	Later people would say that the signs had been there all along: that [MASK] was a little lunatic, that there had always been something off about the Richardson family, that as soon as they heard the sirens that morning they knew something terrible had happened.
MacArthur	According to this ever-proliferating gossip, the General was either going to send these fools to their deaths from his armchair or he was going to return, like [MASK] to the Philippines, to lead the heroic invasion himself.
Congress	I am here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a hand of temporary bad luck, for your soldiers fought well and bravely, and would have prevailed if only [MASK] had remained as steadfast in their support of you as the president promised.
Death	[MASK] visits everybody, the rich, the poor, the blind and the lame. When it visits us, it seems as if our own grief and loss are more than our neighbours’. I conceived eight times. All died before they were six months old.
Grandma	They want somebody to love & live for—women. It doesn’t matter who like it would with a man. & for lunch preparing big grilled cheese sandwiches for me crossed with strips of crisp bacon I was crazy for as a boy visiting [MASK].
Professor	Or somebody pretending to be [MASK] P__with his nasal drone & habit of clearing his throat & pausing to let his words sink in. Cosmic rays from outer space. Of an age many millions of years. More concentrated at higher elevations than lower.
Grandma	[MASK] says. The foundation of our house was laid 1892 & it is still firm. The cellar Grandpa P_had renovated in the 1950s (as I have been told, I was not bom yet) is such that there are two sections: the new, & the old.
Riley	In one window there was a skeleton of a little foot, a little dead foot that gleamed like the white keys of the piano. It made her cry. She thought of home then, the bog road, turf being cut, and her family believing that she was living the life of [MASK].
Horatio	She has never liked him, not since the day of the horse show, when he made her park her car half a mile away and walk in her stiletto shoes. “There are more things, [MASK], in heaven and hell,” he says as he strides down the street.
Adam	Did I blush, I wonder, like a schoolboy: all [MASK]’s apple and big raw knuckles? I don’t know; I felt shy, embarrassed in a way I hadn’t felt for . . . how long?
Punch	He’s pleased as [MASK]. And proud — proud in a way that’s quite unusual for him. It’s a quiet pride; he doesn’t say much about it; but you can tell exactly what he feels simply by looking at him!”
Kim	“Yes.” “Where is it?” “Give me the Kipling book . . . here. ” On the frontispiece of [MASK] was a map with a dotted line for the path the boy and the Holy One took.
Pierre	He found another, similar title. [MASK], or the Ambiguities. He turned and caught the woman’s eyes on him again. He felt as guilty as if he had put the book in his pocket. She had probably never seen a turban before. The English!
Winston	VIII From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee—real coffee, not Victory Coffee—came floating out into the street. [MASK] paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood.
Winston	“Except—” began [MASK] doubtfully, and then stopped. It had been on the tip of his tongue to say “Except the proles,” but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox.
Winston	All three had written long, abject articles in the Times, analyzing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends. Some time after their release [MASK] had actually seen all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe.
Winston	A morning came, and he was missing from work; a few thoughtless people commented on his absence. On the next day nobody mentioned him. On the third day [MASK] went into the vestibule of the Records Department to look at the notice board.
Winston	You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.” He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. [MASK] was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head.
Winston	“You are a flaw in the pattern, [MASK]. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission.
Winston	[MASK] was alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it.
Winston	It was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred to [MASK] that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police. THR€€ He did not know where he was.
Parsons	“Of course I’m guilty!” cried [MASK] with a servile glance at the telescreen. “You don’t think the Party would arrest an innocent man, do you?” His froglike face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression.
Goldstein	When public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals “Death to the traitors!” During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at [MASK].
Winston	“There is no difference between night and day in this place. I do not see how one can calculate the time.” They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. [MASK] sat quietly, his hands crossed.
Winston	Lower, please! That’s better, comrade. Now stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch me.” A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over [MASK]’s body. His face remained completely inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show resentment!
Syme	It had been on the tip of his tongue to say “Except the proles,” but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox. [MASK], however, had divined what he was about to say.
Winston	Bang over’ead! Lay down quick!” “Steamer” was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs. [MASK] promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind.
Winston	Someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearthstone. The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, thought [MASK], how small it always was!
Winston	How easy it was, thought [MASK], if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type set up by the Party as an ideal—tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree— existed and even predominated.
Winston	All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make them true. And, above all, we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, [MASK]. Posterity will never hear of you.
Winston	Just think what they have to put up with. Now try again. That’s better, comrade, that’s much better,” she added encouragingly as [MASK], with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years.
Julia	It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought of [MASK]. Somewhere or other she was suffering, perhaps far worse than he. She might be screaming with pain at this moment.
Parsons	He had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile [MASK] flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week.
Winston	Someone was climbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs. The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands. [MASK] was not trembling any longer.
Julia	When he suggested it to [MASK] she had agreed with unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.
Winston	The largest section of the Records Department, far larger than the one in which [MASK] worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction.
Winston	Already our control over matter is absolute.” For a moment [MASK] ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully. “But how can you control matter?” he burst out.
Winston	By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, [MASK] was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen.
Winston	[MASK] was good at this kind of thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of the Times leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak. He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier.
Winston	It was the lonely hour of fifteen. A tinny music trickled from the telescreens. [MASK] sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall.
Winston	“How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.” “Sometimes, [MASK]. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder.
Winston	[MASK] started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen. “They’ve got you too!” he cried.
Winston	Big Brother Is Watching You, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into [MASK]’s own. Down at street level another poster, tom at one comer, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC.
Titiola	She pronounced it Tee-tee-yo-la, wincing as she said it, knowing that it sounded all wrong in her mouth, jarring. The girl’s head snapped up, her eyes widening. “[MASK],” she said sharply.
Indians	And as to provisions, I will risk my chance of salvation if game does not abound in the interior.” “[MASK] are not the danger. . . . Behind your words I hear a warning.” The Governor leaned toward the friar, who was still standing.
Europeans	Although not fashioned in the way of [MASK], I did not find the Indians of this nation ugly. Their women, who later came to look at us, I also did not find unattractive, although many of them were worn with toil.
Satan	And air was where earth should be; water was in air; earth in water, and everywhere was fire. So mixed were the elements that suddenly, with a roar not heard since [MASK] was cast out by the Lord, all four were one!”
Wesson	She turned her head. “Why’s that? Why were you worried about me? My Smith and [MASK] is at the house.” Because you helped ruin his perfect crime spree, and maybe he knows that, I wanted to say to her.
Mommy	“Can we please, please, please?” “No, I’m sorry, sweetie. [MASK] doesn’t have enough money for that. Not this trip. Next time for sure.” She wondered suddenly why she hadn’t thought to pack sandwiches.
Mary	[MASK] answered as politely as she could that the rooster had flapped his wings and crowed three times at the door, so she knew somebody was coming. She had changed her clothes to look decent to meet her visitor.
Neptune	This goddess of the deep was soon wrestled onto the deck where her bright colours were observed and admired, that is until the loss of blood caused them to fade and the cook made ready to prepare her for dinner. Other representatives of [MASK]’s family occupy us in our peregrination.
Sam	“War or peace, you will come through the door right on schedule with your head buried in a newspaper.” “Good morning,” said [MASK]. The sight of a colored man reading was a never-ending source of wonder and consternation to his coworker.
Talmud	He would be a great man even if he had not inherited his post from his father. It is a pity he occupies his mind only with [MASK]. If he were not a tzaddik he could make a great contribution to the world. But he lives only in his own world.
Danny	“How’s that again?” “I said my brother would probably make a fine tzaddik,” [MASK] said quietly. “It occurred to me recently that if I didn’t take my father’s place I wouldn’t be breaking the dynasty after all.
Johnny	Then almost sadly with grave beauty she said, “You poor silly bastard, giving me cramps like a kid. Ah, [MASK], you always will be a dumb romantic guinea, you even make love like a kid.
Johnny	“He’s a businessman,” the Don said blandly. “I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse.” “It’s too late,” [MASK] said. “All the contracts have been signed and they start shooting in a week.
Kay	He was surprised to find himself so secretive with [MASK]. He loved her, he trusted her, but he would never tell her anything about his father or the Family. She was an outsider. “What about you?”
Michael	[MASK] knelt beside his father, holding his hand, while the other men called for an ambulance and doctor. With a great effort the Don opened his eyes to see his son once more. The massive heart attack had turned his ruddy face almost blue.
Brahma	But, O [MASK], you who sent us the prince propagators of the holy law and sages that smote the darkness of ignorance, you have forgotten us so long that men have come from across the seas and the oceans to trample on our wisdom and to spit on virtue itself.
Buck	We best drop her and be done with it.” He shot. The dogs were on her the instant she hit the ground. If there was a spark of life, it was at once snuffed out. [MASK] climbed up the low tree and shook the limb.
Deer	But the wolves had never before descended on the clearing in a band. [MASK] and small animals had been plentiful to feed them. Only a few had come, singly or in pairs, skulking about timorously, running at the first alarm. They had never before been a major menace.
Jody	Now he went ahead, drilling his holes with a pointed stick down the long rows. [MASK] followed, dropping two kernels to the hole. He was anxious to please, to have his father forget the shrunken tobacco patch.
Jody	It seemed to [MASK] that he would burst if there was further delay. He dashed in to his room and routed out his heavy cow* hide brogans from under the bed. He slipped his feet into them and raced after his father as though the hunt would be done and over before he reached him.
Tom	She didn’t even use your interview. Used [MASK] over at the Legree plantation. What did she give you?” “She just gave me a flat-out fee. I bought a pig, a dog and a goose with it.” “Ha!
Frederick	Abolish slavery and you abolish the invisible chains that hold slaves apart and wrest from them feeling, life, and knowledge.” There was thunder, clapping like thunder. Folks rushed forward, surrounding [MASK] on stage. Chairs toppled. People pushed and shoved.
Africans	But in seventeen ninety-five these slaves did not have the character which you’ve seen in films and novels of the South. They were not soft-spoken, brown-skinned people in drab rags who spoke an English dialect. They were [MASK].
Rowan	Come to me when he sleeps. Tonight, tomorrow, come when you will. There is no time for me. I am here when you say my name. But keep faith with me, [MASK]. Come alone to me, and in secret.
Billy	We were finished; if our lives depended on our marching a mile, we couldn’t have done it. By the time we started, poor young [MASK] had bad cramps and couldn’t even sit upright, so we laid him on some spruce tips in the middle of the raft.
Romans	This morning I read from one of those old sermons your mother keeps leaving around for me. It was on [MASK] I: “They became vain in their reasonings and their senseless heart was darkened, professing themselves to be wise they became fools,” and so on.
Adam	“There are people here now who don’t know me from [MASK]. It’s wonderful.” Then he put his hand to his face, his eyes. It was dark, but I could recognize that gesture. He has made it his whole life, I believe.
Sylvie	[MASK] walked over to the vanity. The cards were dealt for a third hand. “You started without me,” she said. We put bricks on the floor for our feet and wrapped ourselves in quilts and played gin rummy. During those days Fingerbone was strangely transformed.
Angela	Everywhere she is transported by the police as a prisoner, blacks and whites are waiting in the nearby streets, holding up placards for the TV cameras and shouting, “Free [MASK]! End political repression! End racism! End the war!”
Uriah	[MASK] calls out from across the room. He sits with the other Dauntless-born initiates. Only four of them are left; the rest have gone through their fear landscapes already. He pats his leg. “You can sit on my lap, if you want.”
Tris	“Go ahead, [MASK],” he says softly. “I understand. It’s okay.” My eyes burn. “No,” I say, my throat so tight it aches. I shake my head. “I’ll give you ten seconds!”
Four	I can’t even think of life as a Dauntless. All I can think about is making it through initiation. “We will go over technique today, and tomorrow you will start to fight each other,” says [MASK]. “So I recommend that you pay attention.
Four	I close my eyes. I don’t expect [MASK] to reassure me, and he makes no effort to, but I feel better standing here than I did out there among the people who are my friends, my faction. I press my forehead to his shoulder.
Will	“Statistically speaking,” the Erudite boy next to me— his name is [MASK]—says, grinning at me, “you should have hit the target at least once by now, even by accident.” He is blond, with shaggy hair and a crease between his eyebrows.
Christina	the Candor girl who helped me asks briskly. She is tall, with dark brown skin and short hair. Pretty. I nod. “I’m [MASK],” she says, offering me her hand. I haven’t shaken a hand in a long time either.
Tobias	After a moment they all stir, so I know they’re still alive, and the Dauntless soldiers advance. A cluster of black around my brother. “[MASK],” I say. He presses the screen again, and everyone on the first floor goes still.
Eric	“Climb over the railing,” says [MASK] again, pronouncing each word slowly. “If you can hang over the chasm for five minutes, I will forget your cowardice. If you can’t, I will not allow you to continue initiation.”
Freud	So I have desires—only they’re endless. Endless! And that, that may not be such a blessing, taking for the moment a psychoanalytic point of view . .. But then all the unconscious can do anyway, so [MASK] tells us, is want.
Cordelia	When actually what we are playing in that house is some farce version of King Lear, with me in the role of [MASK]! On the phone she is perpetually telling whosoever isn’t listening on the other end about her biggest fault being that she’s too good.
Portnoy	I am afraid to open my mouth for fear that if I do no words will come out—or the wrong words. “[MASK], yes, it’s an old French name, a corruption of porte noir, meaning black door or gate.
Harry	[MASK] took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. “Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body.
Gringotts	“Number one, I don’ know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta [MASK] — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all?
Hermione	“Are you really?” said [MASK]. “I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.
Hagrid	They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said [MASK] quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him.
Neville	But [MASK] was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. “I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”
Hagrid	* * ^ “A Muggle,” said [MASK], “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”
Neville	Anyway, we’d better go and look for [MASK]’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.” And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.
Dumbledore	“The truth.” [MASK] sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll forgive me.
Hagrid	When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. [MASK] greeted them, looking flushed and excited. “It’s nearly out.”
Firenze	“We’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.” “That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said [MASK]. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime.
Harry	A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was screaming! [MASK] snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once.
Hagrid	“Right then,” said [MASK], “now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a moment.”
Harry	“The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.” He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving [MASK] shivering behind him.
Filch	“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us — if [MASK] spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room.
Hermione	I was down in the village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.” “But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said [MASK].
Hagrid	You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ —” [MASK] suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. “Sorry,” he said.
Dudley	“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey. . . .” He strode over to the sofa where [MASK] sat frozen with fear. “Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.
Harry	[MASK] walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail.
Ron	“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.” She sat down. [MASK] looked taken aback. “Er — all right.” He cleared his throat. “Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. ”
Hermione	It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was * * THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR * * * ^ purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. “Look!” [MASK] seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.
Hagrid	“Right, follow me, but careful, now.” They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. “Who’s there?” [MASK] called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”
Harry	The feeling suddenly surged back into [MASK]’s legs. He stumbled backward. “Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as your parents. . . .
Harry	The last thing [MASK] saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. “Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear.
Hagrid	[MASK] frowned at him. “O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason.
Hagrid	The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by [MASK] before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start.
Harry	[MASK] had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night.
Harry	He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. “Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite [MASK].
Hagrid	The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for [MASK], an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
Harry	Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, [MASK]’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.
Harry	There was a lot more to magic, as [MASK] quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.
Hermione	He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. “What can you see?” [MASK] said anxiously. “Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.”
Harry	She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto [MASK]’s plate.
Harry	“I know what you’re thinking about, [MASK], that mirror. Don’t go back tonight.” “Why not?” “I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already.
Harry	“I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s the matter?” “Nothing,” said [MASK]. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?
Hermione	“We’ve got to go, we’re going to be late.” They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when [MASK] caught up with them. “I’m coming with you,” she said. “You are not. ”
Dudley	One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty. . . ten . . . nine — maybe he’d wake [MASK] up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . . BOOM.
Hagrid	Every morning the ground was covered in frost. [MASK] could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun.
Harry	[MASK] looked at the tiny bottle. “There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one swallow.” They looked at each other. “Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”
Harry	[MASK] wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
Harry	People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. [MASK] wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
Harry	So — think you’ve got all that?” “Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” [MASK] reeled off.
Snape	“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on [MASK] — wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it.
Ollivanders	The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read [MASK]: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside.
Estha	His yellow teeth were magnets. They saw, they smiled, they sang, they smelled, they moved. They mesmerized. ‘I asked you where you lived,’ he said, spinning his nasty web. ‘Ayemenem,’ [MASK] said.
Kiwi	[MASK] was the only Bigtree with zero injuries—no stitches, no scars. He’d once cut his pointer finger opening a can of cherry soda after a wrestling match. He tried to imagine his ladylike hands throttling up inside a floatplane.
Miles	She’ll be the next manager of the Empire Grill.” “Over my dead body,” [MASK] said. His brother got to his feet and smiled, clearly having seen this coming. “Good. Now we’ve come full circle.
Miles	“I’d have to run you through the Hobart first,” [MASK] told him. “Rinse some of the crumbs out of your beard. You don’t seem to understand that people come into the Empire Grill to eat, and you’re a walking appetite suppressant.”
Coco	I won’t allow it.’ She did not answer, only fought him silently, twisting like a cat and showing her teeth. Our parrot was called [MASK], a green parrot. He didn’t talk very well, he could say Qui est la?
Grace	What am I doing in this place and who am I? The door of the tapestry room is kept locked. It leads, I know, into a passage. That is where [MASK] stands and talks to another woman whom I have never seen.
Power	They, them, the ruling class on one side, the ruled on the other. [MASK] had changed hands but what else had changed where he lived? If ever there had been an emergency, it was this. "There are laws to protect tenants.
John	Blessed is the man whose bowels move And melt with pity toward the poor. [MASK] struggled with his voice. “You don’t mean—you don’t sing this in church?” “No, not really.”
Kipling	They will be waited on hand and foot, have servants by the dozen, and transfer to the mountains for the hot season.v “You’ve been reading too much [MASK]. You’re thinking of British army officers. 1 don’t believe missionaries live like that.”
Congress	The President, still endeavoring to negotiate, lost so much influence with the legislators that had he failed in April to send [MASK] a message asking for a declaration of war, it would have exercised its constitutional right and acted without a request from him.
Caesar	That is why I hope, in a class with her friends—” “But she is such an ardent soul! I can’t imagine her not throwing herself headlong into any undertaking.” “She has not been ardent about [MASK]’s Gallic Wars, believe me.”
Lister	“I’d like to try to save it. A compound fracture always has meant amputation, but I don’t think it should. [MASK] has saved one or two—there’ve been papers of his printed. I’ll try carbolic acid dressings as he suggests.
Job	So you mustn’t be surprised, nor grieved when—Read the Book of [MASK], and you will see that dying is not something to be afraid of. Verses like, ‘He dis-covereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.’”
Wimsey	I’m a terrific success at pottering round asking sloppy questions. And I can put away quite a lot of beer in a good cause.” The Superintendent grinned, begged [MASK] to come and see him at any time, clambered into his car and drove off.
Wimsey	Ah! they took one on ’em up to Parliament, they did. Cost a heap of money, so they say.” “Well, it seems ridiculous,” said [MASK]. “And with all this unemployment about, too.
Frankenstein	He was driving an orange patchwork car that had been pieced together from so many different versions of the same make and model that it looked like [MASK]’s monster on wheels. A bungee cord held the front hood, which fluttered up and down as it caught the oncoming air.
Muslims	But Congress has had a long tradition of Hindu-Muslim collaboration, and, believe me, it is the obvious party to join. And as far as tickets are concerned, I am giving you my word that there will be fair representation for [MASK].
Lee	“One thing I’m very glad to see. Your General [MASK] is a moralist, as are all true gentlemen, of course, but he respects minor vice, harmless vice, when he finds it in others. Now that’s the mark of the true gentleman.
Walter	“Look, young man, don’t get all worried about that,” [MASK] said. “Just don’t bullshit me. There’s a lot of truth going on here.” “You know what’s the truth?”
Bethlehem	Her prized star of [MASK] sits rooted in its china pot; she likes to study its gray-green leaves for secrets. The wallpaper, too, holds her attention with its rows of flowers, its browns and pinks alternating and repeating.
Ayah	[MASK]’s eyes flash a warning and Ice-candy-man’s serpentine arm floats away. He shifts his eyes from us and stares ingenuously into the fading day. “The padre, poor fellow, still doesn’t know what happened,” he says dreamily.
Jack	Won’t you see them for just five minutes?” Since 1 can’t hear his response, and I’m determined to see him, I throw him a line: "All work and no play makes [MASK] a dull boy!” I know he’ll bite.
Ayah	I dig my face in her sari and stretch up my hands. [MASK] tries to lift me but her fluid strength is gone. Her grip is weak. I hug her fiercely. Her heart beneath her springy breasts is fluttering like Ice-candy-man’s nervous sparrows.
Hitler	“O Lord, make us free! ” prayed [MASK] over the radio, and loud-speakers spread his words in every market-square in every town. On Sunday the people voted, and the Nazi vote increased from nearly twelve million to more than seventeen million.
Hitler	It was true that the school had been built and endowed by a German patron. Said [MASK]: “That kind of thing will be the glory of our National Socialist administration; there will be such an outburst of artistic and musical genius as will astound the world.”
Darling	She picked up on the fourth ring. The sound of her lilting contralto voice soothed arid cooled me. She said, “Oh! [MASK], we’ve suffered through the first five times you called, haven’t we? Please tell me where you are.
Satan	We still in love. Don’t the Lord work in mysterious ways his wonders to perform? It’s been over five years since I seen you right on this corner. He sent you to drive [MASK]’s imps away.
Alice	Contestant number three: What was [MASK]’s, the maid in The Brady Bunch, boyfriend’s name, and what job did he do?” “Oh, I don’t know.” The security guards was laughing so hard they was bent over.
Angela	And for once, not afraid. There was something about these women, these new young women, that made you think that something must be changing, that the time had come to start giving to pretty black women, not taking from them. [MASK] sat on a folding chair.
Angela	Sticking it to the pigs. That’s what it’s all about.” He looked at her breasts, wiped quickly at his nose. “You here alone, sister?” [MASK] sighed. She didn’t feel like playing the game right now.
Sam	“It’s still my place, goddam it, you haven’t moved your wheels and tables up there yet. I got my reasons and I stick to them.” “The thing we came to say is, we may not move the wheels and tables up there at all. So [MASK] says.”
Doc	Before we can?” “I don’t know.” He loosened a hangnail with his thumb. “[MASK] says a year or two.” “A year!” Her mouth seemed to have fallen permanently open. “How’s the preacher?”
Nietzsche	“What do you mean?” “But I know something else: if it is chaos, it will not be chaos forever: ‘out of chaos ye shall give birth to a dancing star!’ [MASK] said that.”
Cinderella	He sounded intrigued, and looked gorgeous. "Who are you?" "I'm [MASK]. My Buick just turned into a pumpkin, and my date turned into a drunk, and I came out here looking for my glass slipper. Have you seen it?"
Lucy	All he knew of pregnancy was what he had seen of his mother in voluminous clothes, six years before, and could still remember, and what he'd seen of I Love [MASK] on TV the year before, when she announced that she was expecting.
Tom	“These here is our own people, all of ’em,” [MASK] said. “I don’ like this.” Suddenly the leading policemen turned off the road into a wide graveled entrance. The old cars whipped after them. The motorcycles roared their motors.
Tom	[MASK] went to the tool shed and brought what tools were left to go, a hand saw and a set of wrenches, a hammer and a box of assorted nails, a pair of pliers and a flat file and a set of rat-tail files.
Tom	[MASK] took off his cloth cap, dirty now, and ruinous, the visor pointed as a bird’s beak. He turned the sweat band out and removed a long strip of folded newspaper. “Sweat so much she’s shrank,” he said.
Tom	“Run out of my uncle,” said [MASK]. “Or he run out, or something.” The gray man looked puzzled and worried at the same time. He touched the tip of his nose tenderly and waggled it around to stop an itch.
Hiro	Y.T.’s in there somewhere, but no point in trying to track her down. She would be embarrassed, anyway, to be seen with an oldster like [MASK]. Now that the concert is up and running, it will take care of itself.
Enki	“Excuse me, but how did Sumerian agriculture work? Did they use a lot of irrigation?” “They were entirely dependent upon it.” “So [MASK] was responsible, according to this myth, for irrigating the fields with his ‘water of the heart.’”
Hiro	“Noise, is more like it.” “Well, all information looks like noise until you break the code,” [MASK] says. “Why would anyone show me information in binary code? I’m not a computer. I can’t read a bitmap.”
Hiro	[MASK] finds the hard power switch and turns it off. Computers this powerful are supposed to shut themselves down, after you’ve asked them to. Turning one off with the hard switch is like lulling someone to sleep by severing their spinal column.
Hiro	“Y.T.,” he says, “where die hell are we?” “Driving down the street toward your house. We overshot it about six times.” Up ahead, the channel dead-ends. [MASK] does a one-eighty.
Hiro	He’s ransacking more data. [MASK] wants to throw a bucket of water on him. “Makes sense,” he says. “You’re as familiar with the Metaverse as anyone. Freelance hacker—that’s exactly right.” “Exactly right for what?
Hiro	“He will try to retaliate by unleashing Snow Crash against the technological priesthood.” “I know that,” [MASK] says, “but I can only woriy about one thing at a time. I could use a little help here.”
Hiro	There’s no door. [MASK] starts walking away from the Street, toward the cube. It reflects no light at all, so he can’t tell whether it’s ten feet or ten miles away from him until the security daemons begin to materialize.
Hiro	So he wanders back out toward the periphery. “Yo! Dude with the swords,” someone says. [MASK] turns around, sees a green-jacketed Enforcer motioning to him. It’s the short, powerful guy with the headset, the guy in charge of the security detail.
Merlin	You don’t sleep even then?” “No.” He set down the goblet beside him, and knitted his hands together. “It’s no use. Nothing is any use. You must bring her to me, [MASK]. You have the arts.
Godfrey	We got drenched in the process.” “You mean to tell me”—Godfrey sounded frankly incredulous—“that you brought your boat out at this time of night to rescue a dolphin?” “Wasn’t it good of him?” I put in eagerly. “Very,” said [MASK].
Michelangelo	“Excellent! Excellent!” cried the cardinal, looking at the models. “Keep working, my dear boy, and soon we’ll have the one we want.” [MASK] asked hoarsely, ‘Then Your Grace would not have me carve either of these in marble?”
Michelangelo	[MASK] was intrigued by the idea. “Beyond the Crucifixion? How do you envisage the piece?” “Life size. With a cross in his arms. In an attitude that will be determined by you.” “Could I think about it?”
Savonarola	He turned aside from a pile of fine gray ash, put there in the deep of night by the faithful to commemorate the spot where [MASK] had been burned, went to the broad steps leading up into die Signoria courtyard.
Michelangelo	“It is the art which, by removing all that is superfluous from the material under treatment, reduces it to that form designed in the artist’s mind. . “With hammer and chisel,” exclaimed [MASK], recovering his calm. “. . .
Michelangelo	“Do you want to he thrown down from this scaffolding?” [MASK] gazed at the marble floor below. “On All Saints’ Day I shall celebrate mass here,” declared the Pope. “It will be two years since I blessed the first half.”
Soderini	“Gonfaloniere [MASK], he wants to see you, he sends a page every hour!” The Piazza della Signoria was aglow with orange light from the burning oil pots that hung from every window and from the top of the crenelated tower.
Michelangelo	“You were better off as an apprentice in the Medici palace. Then, at least, I was able to put away some savings for you.” [MASK] gazed out the window at the figure of the night guard strolling down the Via San Proculo.
Adam	If he could not control his own fate, why be bom? The God of the Sistine vault, about to hand on to [MASK] the spark of life, had implicit in His glorious being the promise of freedom to accompany that life.
Raphael	Come to the Vatican palace tomorrow.” He arrived too early to be received by the Pope, wandered into the Stanza della Segnatura which [MASK] had painted during the years when he himself was up in the Sistine vault.
David	To protect himself he had left half again as much marble at the rear as he would ultimately need, keeping in mind the fact that there were forty views of a statue as one walked around it. He had designed [MASK] as an independent man, standing clear of all space around him.
Michelangelo	To clothe your figure, wet a drapery cloth to the consistency of thick mud, then arrange it around your figure in folds. Later you’ll learn how to expand the model into the size you intend to carve.” “You’ve used the word,” grinned [MASK].
Sam	He looked up and saw a dark form coming up the box-lined path. He thought it was [MASK], his negro of all work, coming back after his scare. The figure paused in front of the piazza and called in a hillman’s voice: “Hello! Hello!”
Tom	But [MASK], taking the first scoop with his wicker basket, said “Thirteen.” And thirteen it turned out to be. It was certainly a relief to knock off for a bit, to straighten one’s back and stretch out one’s fingers.
Pocahontas	He held the bill for closer inspection, though no one was allowed to touch the tender except him. “And the woman here is an Indian princess, [MASK].” Her grandfather pointed at what looked like an eagle beginning flight at the bottom.
Frankenstein	Coming in, I threw on all the lights—desk lamp, bed lamp, chandelier blazing; shrugged my coat on the floor, and headed straight for the shower, unbuttoning my bloodied shirt as I went, stumbling like [MASK]’s monster before pitchforks.
Jose	“jBomba!” cried [MASK], doing a happy step backward when he saw me on the sidewalk; he was the youngest and most buoyant of the doormen, always trying to sneak away before his shift was over to play soccer in the park.
Macbeth	“[MASK] does murder sleep!” He had come only to fetch the key to our house but he seemed determined to wake the entire household. And that was what he did. All at once lights appeared in half a dozen windows of the high brick fa£ade.
Tom	This was disappointing, but it wasn’t certain we had a good place, so we killed another hour mov- ing farther up, skipping two ravines because a bunch of Chinamen were working a cradle in the first one and some people had a Long [MASK] going in the second.
Satan	“Get thee behind me, [MASK]. Or come out and fight in the open.” Everybody cried “A-a-a-amen,” and “If you’re aiming to fight the Reverend, fight fair,” relishing every word.
Caesar	He would often quote the verse 'Give unto [MASK]' to show the separation between the secular and the religious struggles, that one need not exclude the other. But inwardly he knew that religion, any religion, was a weapon against the workers!
Gandalf	‘So do I,’ said [MASK], ‘and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
Isildur	On some errand of mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst mischief was done. ‘Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again. He knows where [MASK] fell.
Gandalf	‘You must trust me now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though [MASK] hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect.
Frodo	It has great virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.’ He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed [MASK]’s shoulder. The fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared.
Frodo	He laid his hand on the hobbit’s shoulder in friendly fashion; but [MASK] felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength.
Bilbo	‘Good ... good luck!’ cried [MASK], stuttering with the cold. ‘I don’t suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a full account when you get back. And don’t be too long!
Sam	We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horribly afraid - but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.’ ‘And after all, sir,’ added [MASK], ‘you did ought to take the Elves’ advice.
Lady	It seemed to them that they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees; and it was enough. They had not seen the Lord and [MASK] again, and they had little speech with the Elven-folk; for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue.
Pippin	We want to go on.’ ‘That’s what I meant,’ said [MASK]. ‘We hobbits ought to stick together, and we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up. There must be someone with intelligence in the party.’
Bilbo	In the end [MASK] won the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his hand came upon the ring he had picked up and forgotten: What have I got in my pocket?
Frodo	Alas! the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can — but all the more do I urge you now to go on without rest.’ He searched the wound on [MASK]’s shoulder with his fingers, and *
Bilbo	‘Well, what about it?’ ‘What do you know already?’ ‘Only what [MASK] told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean.’
Frodo	But I will always help you.’ He laid his hand on [MASK]’s shoulder. ‘I will help you bear this burden, as long as it is yours to bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.’
Bilbo	And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of [MASK] may rule the fate of many - yours not least.
Gandalf	‘I thought I knew the elf-letters, but I cannot read these.’ ‘The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days,’ answered [MASK]. ‘But they do not say anything of importance to us.
Frodo	Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and [MASK] knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one. But he also knew that it could not see him - not yet, not unless he willed it.
Bilbo	I have known few hobbits, save [MASK] here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him. The world has changed much since I last was on the westward roads.
Sam	‘You at least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.’ [MASK] sat down, blushing and muttering.
Frodo	He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness. [MASK] dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. His friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound.
Galadriel	Yet it is not yours to give me, even if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.’ ‘Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,’ said [MASK]; ‘for it was left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.’
Yavanna	Then the seeds that [MASK] had sown began swiftly to sprout and to burgeon, and there arose a multitude of growing things great and small, mosses and grasses and great ferns, and trees whose tops were crowned with cloud as they were living mountains, but whose feet were wrapped in a green twilight.
Morgoth	To Men [MASK] feigned pity, if any would hearken to his messages, saying that their woes came only of their servitude to the rebel Noldor, but at the hands of the rightful Lord of Middle-earth they would get honour and a just reward of valour, if they would leave rebellion.
Sauron	They could walk, if they would, unseen by all eyes in this world beneath the sun, and they could see things in worlds invisible to mortal men; but too often they beheld only the phantoms and delusions of [MASK].
Nahar	And Orome tamer of beasts would ride too at whiles in the darkness of the unlit forests; as a mighty hunter he came with spear and bow, pursuing to the death the monsters and fell creatures of the kingdom of Melkor, and his white horse [MASK] shone like silver in the shadows.
Sauron	But for a long time he did not dare to challenge the Lords of the Sea, and he withdrew from the coasts. Yet [MASK] was ever guileful, and it is said that among those whom he ensnared with the Nine Rings three were great lords of Numendrean race.
Radagast	He gathered a great host of spies, and many of these were birds; for [MASK] lent him his aid, divining naught of his treachery, and deeming that this was but part of the watch upon the Enemy.
Sauron	And one by one, sooner or later, according to their native strength and to the good or evil of their wills in the beginning, they fell under the thraldom of the ring that they bore and under the domination of the One, which was [MASK]’s.
Beren	Then [MASK] lay upon the ground in a swoon, as one slain at once by bliss and grief; and he fell into a sleep as it were into an abyss of shadow, and waking he was cold as stone, and his heart barren and forsaken.
Maedhros	Then hope was renewed in the hearts of the Elves; and in that very time, at the third hour of morning, the trumpets of [MASK] were heard at last coming up from the east, and the banners of the sons of Feanor assailed the enemy in the rear.
Yavanna	‘Of all thy realm what dost thou hold dearest?’ ‘All have their worth,’ said [MASK], ‘and each contributes to the worth of the others. But the kelvar can flee or defend themselves, whereas the olvar that grow cannot.
Maeglin	Yet if in Aredhel your sister you have some claim, then let her remain; let the bird go back to the cage, where soon she will sicken again, as she sickened before. But not so [MASK]. My son you shall not withhold from me.
Morgoth	Certain it is whence they came, and the evil truth was enhanced and poisoned by lies; but the Sindar were yet unwary and trustful of words, and (as may well be thought) [MASK] chose them for this first assault of his malice, for they knew him not.
Tom	These aint th days of hounds an Uncle [MASK]’s Cabin, feller. White folks aint in fer all them theatrics these days. Theys more direct than that. If what they wanted was t get y, theyd have just marched right in an took y where y sat.
Tom	They swarmed. A large man with dead-white face and flabby cheeks came to him and almost jabbed a gun-barrel through his guts. “Hands behind y, nigger.” [MASK]’s wrist were bound. The big man shoved him to the well.
Nina	Simply put, the Count found political discourse of any persuasion to be tedious. But then, wasn’t that exactly what a fuddy-duddy would argue ... ? Needless to say, the Count followed [MASK] up the stairs to the second floor.
Blackwell	‘I think you’ll find us competitive,’ the Crosse and [MASK]’s rep contends later still, in the office. ‘Grossed up, I’d say those terms are out of competition’s reach.’ It’s not of interest; it doesn’t matter.
Thee	“Oh. Well, good.” He started whistling the last hymn they had practiced: “Just a Closer Walk with [MASK].” He sauntered beside her with his hands in his pockets. They passed a couple kissing at a bus stop.
Ari	What else is there to see?” “I saved the children’s compound for last. We have Pal-mach headquarters there.” As they entered the children’s compound [MASK] was once again pounced upon by a Palmachnik.
Jim	[MASK] could restrain himself no longer. The ten-year-old little boy grabbed his six-year-old sister and, lifting her in his arms, began to dance his jig and sing, You is free, you is free!
Avery	Weeds come up on my land, I chop ’em up. Trash blow over it I burn it. He rise to go. Hand me his glass. Next time he come I put a little Shug [MASK] pee in his glass. See how he like that.
Nikon	She opened the knapsack, feeling a little overcautious about the expensive equipment he handled so casually, and took out the camera. It said "[MASK]" on the chrome plating of the viewfinder, with an "F" to the upper left of the name.
Susans	"Yes, it is. We take these old bridges for granted around here and don't think much about them." He walked to her and held out a small bouquet of wildflowers, black-eyed [MASK]. "Thanks for the guided tour."
Mrs.	"Yes. A little place with cabins. Something-or-other Motor Court. I just checked in this morning. Haven't even unloaded my gear yet." "That's the only place to stay, except for [MASK] Carlson's,- she takes in roomers.
Dylan	The only song of [MASK]'s he had ever really cared for was "Girl from the North Country." He could play and sing that one, and he hummed the words to himself as he left behind the place with giant red holes in the earth.
Henry	“My dog would just be sneezing.” Big, [MASK] says. He shrugs and laughs. He has eyes the color of bleached-out asphalt, and when he smiles, they shrink to fingernails in his face. “Your dog wouldn’t be able to breathe.
Willie	and I let her cook it. [MASK] kept on looking at her, waiting while she turned to one side and uncorked my bottle and poured herself out a steady-er. She took it, and without any ladylike cough. “Told me what?”Willie said.
Samson	They love him because they— women, I mean—are like the bees in [MASK]’s parable in the Bible: they like to build their honeycomb in the carcass of a dead lion. Out of the strong shall come forth sweetness.
Tom	There might be a flicker of that left the next morning when he opened the Sunday sporting page, but it certainly didn’t last out the week. And [MASK] was not doing a thing to make up to the old man for the trouble he had caused.
Faust	He has been chewing over this idea that I can “buy” time in exchange for bits of my soul, and he wondered if I likened myself to [MASK]. Nothing like an arcane literary debate with your tyrannical master while you pass the time leading to your execution.
Tommy	n maybe [MASK]. Why am ah giein the cunt such a bad press? Is it solely because ay his neglect ay parental duties, or indeed his lack of acknowledgement ay parental status? it’s more likely because I envy the cunt. He doesnae care.
Begbie	Ah jist hate meat. It makes us puke. Endy story. — Well, ah still fuckin say yir fuckin spoilin it fir ivray cunt else. — How? — Cause ah fuckin sais, that’s fuckin how! [MASK] hisses, pointing to himself. i
Peter	The heralds presented their drawings for his coat of arms: crossed keys for [MASK]’s charge, a bear rampant on a white ground, above it the dove of the Paraclete, and, beneath, the motto, ‘Ex ortente lux.
Death	But even if it had been an ordinary child, [MASK] should not have taken it, for it was absolutely necessary, if the universe was not to be a chaos of pain, that parents should die before their children.
Prey	The animals don’t move. Men and women in conservative businesswear keep their distance as they navigate the plaza, towards subways and watering holes and lunch establishments. [MASK], afraid deep in the strata of their consciousness of the predator’s waking, improbable and impending.
Thursday	‘Let me see. [MASK]?’ She had grown contemplative of the whole of time. ‘Now, had it been Wednesday, that is always inconvenient. And Friday, that would be out of the question.
Moses	So he shakes his head and moves on, a wave of pedestrians parting before him like he’s brandishing [MASK]’s rod. A few blocks farther on, in the alley behind the golden arches, sits the best Dumpster for half a mile in any direction.
Shakespeare	This is a play featuring skinny black kids. Point of the whole thing is for them to master [MASK]. To leam from putting on the play. To teach their teachers and families. Maybe teach this whole neanderthal city what kids are capable of.
Jim	[MASK] felt abashed for a moment. He knew well what were her objections. "You's had trial of white folks any how. They run off and left ye, and now none of 'em come near ye to see if you's dead or alive.
Jane	[MASK] begged her to follow her so soon as she should be released; but so wearied out was she by her mistress, she felt disposed to flee from any and every one having her similitude of name or feature. CHAPTER XI. MARRIAGE AGAIN.
John	"I do mean it. The child does as much work as a woman ought to; and just see how she is kicked about!" "Why do you have it so, [MASK]?" asked his sister. "How am I to help it?
Judas	“They want me to betray him,” [MASK] almost whispered. “They have offered me thirty pieces of silver.” “What are you saying?” “That’s it. The man has performed miracles. He speaks of love and he treats everybody the same.
Allah	All praise to [MASK], I said. My brother drove me to the subway, kissed my forehead, and hugged me hard. When had he become a man? For so long, he had been my little brother, sweet and solemn, his eyes open wide to the world.
Allah	I’ve been sent by the prophet Elijah, in the name of [MASK], he said, with a message for you, my beautiful black brother. The man looked at me, his eyes moving slowly over my bare legs. You’re a black queen, he said.
Nora	At least I know you. We’ve danced. Two whole dances.” “Oh?” “At the Ninety-second Street Y. The dance after the play. The night you played [MASK] in A Doll’s House.” She regarded him more carefully.
Willie	Sailors on nearby ships stopped working to stare at the Caine s torn-up seared deckhouse and the huge black hole amidships. [MASK] went below, discarded his wet, filthy clothes in a heap on the deck of his room, and took a steamy shower.
Willie	Saturday night [MASK] was in his room, dressing to go to the opera. His eye fell on his wrist watch, and he realized that in twelve hours he would be on an airplane, returning to the Caine and the court-martial.
Bigger	“I know how you feel, boy. You’re colored and you feel that you haven’t had a square deal, don’t you?” the man’s voice came low and soft; and [MASK], listening, hated him for telling him what he knew was true.
Bigger	The white man’s eyes were steadily upon him. Panic seized [MASK] as he saw the white man lower his head, narrow his eyes still more, sweep back his coat and ram his hands into his pants’ pockets, revealing as he did so a shining badge on his chest.
Bigger	[MASK] relaxed and felt his heart pounding. He longed for something to happen so that the white faces would stop staring at him. Finally, the faces turned away. The coroner strode to the table and lifted the kidnap note with a slow, long, delicate, and deliberate gesture.
Bigger	“About eight-thirty, suh.” [MASK] knew that this was it. This man was here to find out everything. This was an examination. He would have to point his answers away from himself quite definitely. He would have to tell his story.
Mao	The years under [MASK]'s communist rule seemed to have been wiped out by the pink napkin in the hand of a young waitress, who wore a scarlet qi dress with high slits through which one could see flashes of her white thighs.
Sheila	His son jumped into his arms before he was barely out of the car. “Hey, dude. Ready to go?” “Yep. Gotta go get my stuff.” [MASK] stepped out of her apartment, leaned over the railing and smiled seductively.
